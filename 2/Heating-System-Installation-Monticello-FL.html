<p>Indoor contaminants. These consist of chemicals used in the building or renovation of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Incomplete combustion and poor ventilation of these devices (cook stoves, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor pollutants. Gas cook tops ought to be utilized with fans that send out exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating appliances need to be sealed and power-vented systems installed to get rid of items of insufficient combustion.
