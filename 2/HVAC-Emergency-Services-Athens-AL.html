Standing water in humidifiers, cooling systems, on roofs and in boiler pans can end up being polluted with fungis or germs and need to be eliminated, also. In some situations, particular testing for radon or for asbestos might be required as part of structure tenancy. For instance, in schools asbestos needs to be inspected every three years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Threat Emergency Response Act-AHERA).<p>
