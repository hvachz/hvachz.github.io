The job of an HVAC technician is relatively complicated and can vary substantially from one office or home to the next. Every maintenance job and repair is different from the last. Every maintenance task may require absolutely different actions and processes than the previous, depending upon the age and condition of the system being examined. Installations can also differ considerably, depending upon the age of the structure and how well the existing system was installed. In many cases, entirely brand-new ductwork might need to be installed in a structure that had none before.<p>

<p>The primary health impact related to exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
