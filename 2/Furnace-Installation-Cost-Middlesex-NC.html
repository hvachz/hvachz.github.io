<p>I typically don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my alternatives. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about choices. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household pal and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
