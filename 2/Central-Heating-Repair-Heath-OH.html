<p>The guidelines that included the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the very same.

Don't put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively treat and harden-- usually 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom flooring.<p>
