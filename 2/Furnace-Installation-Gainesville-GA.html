<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended guarantees or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to sell me something I do not need.<p>
