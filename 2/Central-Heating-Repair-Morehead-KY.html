<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall.

Due to the fact that they don't require any new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions. Due to the fact that an unit is installed in each room or location you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature level in the space when you are present.<p>
