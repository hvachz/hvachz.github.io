<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must briefly change back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
