<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork at Columbia MD</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were really happy that somebody as experienced as Adam was able to fix the air and return conditioner. We had actually acquired the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any property buyers: employ Blue Flame to evaluate the air conditioning unit prior to you purchase. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to check AC systems even in winter season. We want we had understood him then.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a tube twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year turned off the electrical energy open the furnace and extremely thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
