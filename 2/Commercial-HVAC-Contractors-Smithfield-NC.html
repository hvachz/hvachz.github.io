<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the rate terrific but Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the total air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I believe any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you need to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
