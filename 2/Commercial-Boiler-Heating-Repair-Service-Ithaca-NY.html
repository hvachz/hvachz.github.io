<p>Truth: Geothermal systems really consume no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that very same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceptionally uncommon now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact get rid of countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>A geothermal heatpump is among the most energy efficient methods of heating or cooling a home. Depending on a series of liquid-filled pipes, a house can be warmed in cooler months by condensing and transferring energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperatures found just a couple of feet below ground. In the summertime, the procedure reverses, therefore cooling a home by eliminating heat. Underground temperature level stays constant no matter the climate, so geothermal systems supply constant and trusted heating & cooling.<p>

Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's great air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it.
