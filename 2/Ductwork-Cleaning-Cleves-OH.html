<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
