<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
