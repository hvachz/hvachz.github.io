<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Properly maintained heating equipment can last for several years. But if you're experiencing frequent breakdowns or your fuel bills suddenly appear greater than typical, it is probably time to think about a new system. New heating equipment is far more efficient-- you'll see lower fuel bills immediately, not to point out the cash you'll save on repair costs. You can probably expect to cut your fuel costs in half if your heating system is 25 years old or more.<p>

<p>If you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz, you're probably hearing the fan motor attempting to start without the increase it requires from the capacitor. You can almost always conclude that the capacitor has failed. Often you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pressing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. But the chances are excellent that this might work for one cycle, however the capacitor will stop working next time the AC goes on. It's best to replace the capacitor.<p>
<p>Great Product! Shipment was kind of weird being that package was opened and items could have fell out. However after review of contents we ensured it was all intact. The product was extremely lite weight and requires time to use. Note: purchase suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to enjoy the video first prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we dealt with problems. I would recommend this item to anybody who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
