<p>At present, EPA does not advise using air cleaners to lower levels of radon and its decay products. Because they just partially eliminate the radon decay items and do not reduce the amount of radon getting in the house, the effectiveness of these gadgets is uncertain. EPA prepares to do additional research study on whether air cleaners are, or could end up being, a reliable methods of lowering the health risk from radon. EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, offers additional details on air-cleaning devices to lower indoor air contaminants.<p>

<p>PE firms tend to operate with the objective of selling or spinning off a company at some point. This might be through a public offering, a sale to a large organisation in the field, or perhaps a sale to another PE company. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE company Ares Management. Ares bought CoolSys from Audex, another PE firm, earlier this year. Audex had owned CoolSys for 3 years before that.<p>
<p>Consider possible impacts of indoor air contamination if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heater. Follow the producer's directions, particularly instructions on the correct fuel and keeping the heater correctly adjusted.

While an area heater is in usage, open a door from the space where the heater lies to the remainder of the house and open a window a little.<p>
