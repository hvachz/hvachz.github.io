<p>A packaged unit, generally installed on the roofing, is most typically utilized on commercial buildings, but it is likewise a choice for house owners to think about. Often times, these systems include not just the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those aiming to conserve cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system separately, since the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are generally only available for larger houses due to their high power and capability.

For that reason, this may not be the very best option for homeowners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>
