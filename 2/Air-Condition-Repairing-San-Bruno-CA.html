<p>Excellent Item! Delivery was kind of odd being that the box was opened and items might have fell out. But after review of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The item was exceptionally lite weight and takes some time to apply. Note: purchase suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to see the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we solved concerns. I would suggest this product to anyone who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
