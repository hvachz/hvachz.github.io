<p>A Lot Of Midtown Houston Tx clients do not know why their HVAC unit is not working when they position a 24 hr emergency ac repair demand. The copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending upon how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have an excellent idea of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The first thing you require to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is filthy, you're in luck, that's probably your problem.

The simplest method to thaw your HVAC equipment is to leave the system off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air because my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung around repairing the issue, all the while describing everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working correctly. He had to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will certainly use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
