<h3>Repair and Care for Lexington KY Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was quick and extremely clear about his evaluation, guaranteeing I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>All heater have some level of air purification. From the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all require some fundamental maintenance.

<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge contaminants.) However, measures such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays a crucial role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of procedures which leads to the supply and removal of air from inside a building." Those procedures include bringing in outside air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the structure, and moving some portion of indoor air exterior. The quality of indoor air will be affected if one or more of these processes are underperforming.<p>
