<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets requests for consultation and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. However, much of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were popular in the very first half of the 20th century, specifically in commercial buildings, apartment and very large houses. Many steam and radiator boiler systems installed more than 50 years ago remain operable, since the absence of moving parts makes them less susceptible to tear and wear. A steam boiler replacement costs between $4,000 and $30,000, depending upon boiler size.<p>

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by building and construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in structures through mechanical and natural ventilation.

<p>Co2 (CO2) might not be the most pernicious factor affecting indoor air quality, however it is typically utilized as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level.
