<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things first. Make sure all the signs up in your house are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). The reduced air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually fixed the problem.<p>
