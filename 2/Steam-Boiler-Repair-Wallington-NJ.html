<p>An undersize system won't have the ability to cool spaces down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate due to the fact that it has to run longer than a properly sized unit. Due to the fact that it just takes more electrical power to run a bigger system, an oversize compressor also costs more to run. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a chance to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the required moisture. The result is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature suggests. In fact, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>
