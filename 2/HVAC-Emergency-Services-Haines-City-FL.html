<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. Connection problems along the line that supplies power to your furnace can compromise the efficiency of the system. Loose, faulty or missing wires will cause the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and disrupt service. Part of maintaining your furnace involves examining the advised connections as well as temperature and pressure assesses. Take time to examine these parts for dust and damage, ensuring that they are secure and tight.<p>

<p>Filters can get dirty quickly, specifically if you live in an area that can be dirty. The HVAC system filters trap all kinds of dust, particles, bacteria, and clean the air.

The heating & cooling will mishandle and the indoor air quality will aggravate. Inspecting and changing the air filters is one of the most essential elements of HVAC maintenance.<p>
