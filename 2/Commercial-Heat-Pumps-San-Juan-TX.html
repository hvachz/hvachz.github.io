<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must briefly change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
