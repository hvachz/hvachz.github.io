<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets requests for consultation and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. The probability of instant responses to indoor air contaminants depends on several factors including age and preexisting medical conditions.

<p>Truth: Federal and local incentives typically total up to between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can frequently make the preliminary cost of a system competitive with conventional devices. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capacity, throughout brand-new construction (houses normally utilize between one and five lots). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per heap, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per load. However, brand-new installation practices are minimizing costs, to the point where the price is getting closer to standard systems under the right conditions.<p>
