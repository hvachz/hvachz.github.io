<h3>The Way to Select An Expert HVAC Tech in Bowie MD</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, conducted a research study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Because an a/c moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both must be kept clean. This implies that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise essential to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to harm to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
