<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his employees, equipment expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't sound like much, especially if the objective of owning a business was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it required to build the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't the end goal. HVAC business owners need to pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the same in all other areas.<p>
<p>Air conditioners can develop a great deal of water since they eliminate wetness from the air. To get rid of this, they have a typically plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. In time, algae can obstruct this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work. In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can likewise puddle around the system or flood the area. To handle condensate issues, please see A/c Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
