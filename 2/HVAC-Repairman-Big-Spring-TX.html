<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you ought to look out for. Initially, you should examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
