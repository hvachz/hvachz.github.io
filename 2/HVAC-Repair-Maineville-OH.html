<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outside - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heaters are still commonly used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are developed.

When radon becomes caught in concentrations and structures develop inside, direct exposure to radon becomes a concern.<p>
