<p>I normally do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not anticipate having to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
