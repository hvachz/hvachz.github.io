<p>Recognized as a leader in the HVAC industry, Bard Production combines quality products and impressive service with innovation and technological advances to deliver high-performance cooling and heating items around the globe. A multi-split system 56 is a standard split system, which is divided into two parts (evaporator and condenser) and permits cooling or heating of numerous spaces with one external unit. In the outside system of this air conditioner there is a more powerful compressor, ports for linking numerous traces and automation with locking valves for managing the volume of refrigerant provided to the indoor systems located in the space.<p>
