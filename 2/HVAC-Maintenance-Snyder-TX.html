<p>The main issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, employees try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system develops more difficulties, considering that a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the a/c individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor units operate separately from each other.<p>
