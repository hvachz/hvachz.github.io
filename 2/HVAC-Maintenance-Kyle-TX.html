<p>Next, and maybe just as crucial when it pertains to central air costs, is the AC system's size. A system that is too large will have an easy time keeping the home cool, but will have a harder time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not be able to correctly cool the house on hot days. Considering larger units cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air system requires to hold.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, often described as central air conditioning" or split-system cooling", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the walls, floors, or ceilings covered by grills) bring cooled air from the a/c unit to the house. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it circulates through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Learn how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
