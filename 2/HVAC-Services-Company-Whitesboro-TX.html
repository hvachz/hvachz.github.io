<p>Wetness management and humidity control needs running HVAC systems as developed. Wetness management and humidity control might contravene efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply makeup air at lower temperatures (design levels), instead of the higher temperatures sometimes used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions.

On those days when you simply can't appear to warm up and discover you need to show up your thermostat, your furnace can draw all the humidity out of your house and leave your sinuses throbbing. In-floor heating systems are not vulnerable to this problem because they heat surface areas and not the air itself.
