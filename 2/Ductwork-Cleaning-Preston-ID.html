Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per lot, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per load.

In addition, a fresh, tidy filter better traps impurities and debris in the air. Energy Star recommends changing your filter when every 3 months. During high usage months, examine the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
