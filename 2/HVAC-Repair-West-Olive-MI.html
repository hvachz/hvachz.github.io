<h3>Duct Cleaning in Your West Olive MI Home</h3>
<p>Initially, unlike central air, you have a few choices when it comes to central heating systems. We'll jump into costs later, but you can pick from a heat, furnace or boiler  pump. In general, heaters are the most cost effective alternative. However, your option will largely come down to what your ducts enable or what was previously in your home. Ask your heating contractor for the most appropriate option.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
