<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
