Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile tube) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
