<p>A bioaerosol is an air-borne product of a biological contaminant. Biological contaminants in the home might consist of mold, germs, viruses, mites, and pollen. Bioaerosols released into the air can be distributed throughout the house by the HVAC system. Bioaerosols can cause contagious illness such as Legionnaires' illness.

<p>4 Seasons has set up both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have found them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do great work.
