<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Items HVAC Repairin Corte Madera CA</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are very effective, since ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature level is always at a continuous temperature level. These systems can obtain a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only achieve an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter.

COP rates just how much heat a system eliminates or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling result. Many ground source heatpump have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this suggests is that for each system of energy used by a geothermal heatpump, approximately 3 to 5 units are supplied back in the kind of heat.<p>
