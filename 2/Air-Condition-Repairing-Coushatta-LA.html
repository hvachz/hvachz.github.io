<p>Central air systems are measured in tons. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it indicates the amount of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 should be calibrated frequently, and outdoor measurements utilized for estimations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors might also be needed.<p>
