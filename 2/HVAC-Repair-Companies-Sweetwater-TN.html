What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about options. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
