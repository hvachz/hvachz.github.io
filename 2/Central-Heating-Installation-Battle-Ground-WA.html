An alternative to packaged systems is making use of separate indoor and outdoor coils in split systems Split systems are chosen and commonly utilized around the world except in North America. In The United States and Canada, divided systems are most often seen in residential applications, but they are gaining appeal in little commercial structures. The split systems are a terrific choice for small buildings where ductwork is not feasible or where the space conditioning effectiveness is of prime issue. 19 The advantages of ductless cooling systems consist of simple installation, no ductwork, greater zonal control, flexibility of control and quiet operation. citation required In area conditioning, the duct losses can represent 30% of energy usage. 20 The use of minisplit can result in energy savings in space conditioning as there are no losses associated with ducting.<p>
<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones, the primary issue. While setting up a separate split system, employees try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system creates more difficulties, considering that some of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning separately for each space.
