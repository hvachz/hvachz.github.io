<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have actually been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you select them up.

<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often give off contaminants.)

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
