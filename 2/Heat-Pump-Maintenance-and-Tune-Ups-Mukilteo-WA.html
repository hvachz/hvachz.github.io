<p>These people have actually been terrific. At a real estate agent, I in some cases require contractors to give me an opinion for what deal with a home may cost. Just recently I needed to call on these people two times. They came out rapidly and gave me a no nonsense estimate for the work. Even when it was news my client most likely wouldn't want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I appreciate the honesty. Integrity isn't just their name, it's a business design they take seriously. You guys are formally on speed dial. Talk to you soon.<p>
<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the same. Once the electrical wiring is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Do not put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately solidify and cure-- normally two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>
<p>Advanced styles of new houses are beginning to feature mechanical systems that bring outside air into the house. A few of these designs consist of energy-efficient heat recovery ventilators (likewise known as air-to-air heat exchangers). To learn more about air-to-air heat exchangers, contact the Conservation and Renewable Resource Questions and Referral Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>
