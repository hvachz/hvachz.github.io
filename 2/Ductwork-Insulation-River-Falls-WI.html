<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
