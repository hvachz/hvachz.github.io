<p>Old lead-based paint is the most considerable source of lead direct exposure in the U.S. today. Harmful exposures to lead can be produced when lead-based paint is poorly eliminated from surfaces by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning.

<p>A geothermal heater is more reputable than alternatives, and is not affected by any external factors, unlike other renewable energies such as wind energy and solar energy. For example, wind energy can only be utilized when there is wind, while solar power depends on regular sunlight to work effectively. Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the wind nor the sun, but rather takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is always hot. This makes geothermal heating a offered and reliable  source of energy.<p>
