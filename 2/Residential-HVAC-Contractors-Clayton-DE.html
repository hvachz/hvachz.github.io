<h3>Central Air Conditioning System in Clayton Delaware</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the home.<p>
<p>Oftentimes, if materials have failed to dry out several days after the suspected water event, mold development is suspected within wall cavities even if it is not immediately noticeable. Through a mold examination, which might include destructive examination, one should have the ability to determine the presence or lack of mold. In a situation where there shows up mold and the indoor air quality might have been compromised, mold removal might be needed. Mold testing and assessments should be performed by an independent private investigator to prevent any dispute of interest and to guarantee accurate outcomes; free mold screening offered by remediation companies is not recommended.<p>
