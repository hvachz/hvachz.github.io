We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are typically 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the exact same contaminants.

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>Additionally, homeowners have a variety of choices to select from in powering a flooring heater. Glowing systems work with electrical, natural gas, even geothermal and solar energy sources.
