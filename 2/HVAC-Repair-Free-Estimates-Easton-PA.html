<p>The main issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, employees attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little.

The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the cooling separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>
