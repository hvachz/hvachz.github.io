<p>Indoor temperatures are often more challenging to control than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity needs to be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to reduce mold growth.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transferred by animals and individuals; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful irritant. It can become airborne when it dries. Contaminated central air handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these pollutants through the house.<p>
