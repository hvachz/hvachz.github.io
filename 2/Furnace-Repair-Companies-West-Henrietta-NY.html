<h3>Residential HVAC in West Henrietta New York</h3>
<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either because of noticeable growth or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and maintain. Leaky return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
