<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and young kids can be extreme. They include delays in psychological and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Babies, fetuses, and kids are more susceptible to lead exposure than grownups given that lead is more easily soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more conscious the harmful effects of lead. Kids might have greater direct exposures because they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>

<p>Many central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system.

When the ac system works however the house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
