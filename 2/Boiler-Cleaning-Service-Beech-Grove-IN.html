<p>A hydronic glowing flooring heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a maze of pipelines set up under the flooring or right within the flooring surface area itself. The heat from the hot water transfers to the flooring mass and after that radiates through thermal transfer to other short articles with solid mass such as the walls, ceilings, furnishings and individuals.
