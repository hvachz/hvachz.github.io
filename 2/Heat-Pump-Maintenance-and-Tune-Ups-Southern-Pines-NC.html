<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not provide them.. Secondly like prolonged auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential skills to do the job and also the morals to treat clients fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be completely benefited from. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to properly service and the unit has actually been operating problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very valuable in gathering information on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to momentarily deal with the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and used clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started.
