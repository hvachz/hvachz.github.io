<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- provide All Vovo a call! Heatpump work extremely well in temperate environments like King and South Snohomish counties.

<h3>Air Filter Replacement in Lebanon Connecticut</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs silently and efficiently, however to have 2 significant elements fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the billing before work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
