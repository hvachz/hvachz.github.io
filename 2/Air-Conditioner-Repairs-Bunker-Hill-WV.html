<p>Generally the most reliable way to improve indoor air quality is to eliminate individual sources of contamination or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adapted to reduce the amount of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is also a more cost-efficient method to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses.
