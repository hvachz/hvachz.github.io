Some sources, such as developing materials, home furnishings and products like air fresheners, can launch toxins basically constantly.

<p>The first air conditioning unit and refrigerators employed flammable or poisonous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that could lead to fatal mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion home and building convenience cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
