<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
