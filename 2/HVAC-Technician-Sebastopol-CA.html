As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be entirely taken advantage of.

The heat exchanger permits air to be warmed without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, providing warm air to specific bedrooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
