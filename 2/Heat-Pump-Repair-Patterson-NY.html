HVAC specialists suggest following this basic rule when choosing whether it's worth purchasing a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost over half the rate of a new system, it's best to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have many more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than essential.<p>
