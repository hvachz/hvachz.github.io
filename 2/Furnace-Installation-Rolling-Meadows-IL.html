CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in big residential, office, and school buildings.<p>

<p>1. Central Air Conditioning Source Heat Pumps Air source heat pumps work best in a mild climate, where the temperature level doesn't get too low or too high. To put it simply, they are perfect for our Seattle climate! They are extremely effective, beating out most other kinds of heater in performance. The only genuine exception to this would be a geothermal heatpump system. Nevertheless, a geothermal installation usually costs 10s of thousands more than an air source heatpump, which typically suggests it stops working in terms of return on investment.<p>

<p>Indoor air contamination comes from a range of sources; the US Epa (EPA) has identified building materials, home furnishings, and mold as major concerns, but much of the risk also comes from burning things. For example, cigarette smoking or burning wood for heating or cooking can create contamination in houses that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is an especially huge concern in the developing world.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. At the same time, heat is absorbed from indoors and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
