<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Nick B. provided exceptional, individualized, attentive, and quality service. His interaction design is friendly, appealing and efficient. He clearly and completely described all problems and fixes in a manner that made me positive in his ability to resolve my repair problems. He followed through and went above and beyond to personally pick up a needed part that was not in stock, making sure repairs were made so that my better half and I would not have to sustain another night without heat, during among the coldest winter seasons in current memory. He also responded to my call instantly the next morning, and coached me through a short-term fix to a problem that couldn't be solved on the first check out due to not available parts. I trust Nick's skills, experience and ability to deliver constant, quality service.<p>
<p>The predominant health impact connected with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might present dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your risk of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
