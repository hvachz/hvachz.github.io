<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your house at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will require a much bigger AC system than a smaller sized house, which will impact installation costs. Likewise a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will require far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other aspects that can affect this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>An AC system maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single see, or you can sign up for a maintenance strategy with your local heating and a/c company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get one or two maintenance visits annually, plus another service call, a discount on parts, and generally some other benefits. Some companies provide top priority consultations to their maintenance strategy members.<p>

These systems can attain a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can only attain an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Much like other types of heatpump, ground source heatpump have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE). COP rates how much heat a system produces or removes (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to develop the heating or cooling effect. Most ground source heat pumps have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this implies is that for each system of energy used by a geothermal heatpump, roughly 3 to 5 systems are supplied back in the type of heat.<p>
