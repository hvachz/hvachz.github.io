<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either because of visible growth or a moldy odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and maintain. Dripping return ducts can likewise present moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer auto debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of money being available in monthly, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to offer auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
