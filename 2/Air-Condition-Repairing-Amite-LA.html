<p>You are a covidiot if you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and no one else could come except for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, however they had to order it. My spouse said that she had actually seen an excellent review for James, so I called. He was available in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the circumstance to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He offered to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most good individuals I have satisfied in a very long time.
