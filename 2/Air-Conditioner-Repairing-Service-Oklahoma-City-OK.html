<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged period of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy.

<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the exact same. Once the electrical wiring is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Don't put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately harden and treat-- generally two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom floor.<p>
