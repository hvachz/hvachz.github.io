The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy.
