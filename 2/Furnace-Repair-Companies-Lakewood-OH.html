If you have actually installed the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature, and the system does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
