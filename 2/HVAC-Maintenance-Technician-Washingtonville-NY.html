<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Filters can get unclean easily, especially if you reside in a location that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all type of dust, debris, germs, and tidy the air. They're responsible for keeping the indoor air quality. Your HVAC system will eventually stop performing as you anticipate it to if they're not cleaned up and replaced regularly. The cooling and heating will be inefficient and the indoor air quality will intensify. Examining and altering the air filters is one of the most important aspects of HVAC maintenance.<p>
