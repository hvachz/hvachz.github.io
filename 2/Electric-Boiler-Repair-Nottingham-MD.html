<p>The majority of well and city water does not generally include lead. Water normally gets lead inside the house from home pipes that is made with lead materials. If there is lead in drinking water is to have it evaluated, the only way to know. Contact the local health department or the water supplier to learn how to get the water evaluated. Send for the EPA pamphlet, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for additional information about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water.

<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air problems by including new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often discharge pollutants.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outside air penetrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an important role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of processes which results in the supply and elimination of air from inside a building." Those processes consist of bringing in outdoors air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the building, and moving some part of indoor air exterior. If several of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be affected.<p>
