<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
