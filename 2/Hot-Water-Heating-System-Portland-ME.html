<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
