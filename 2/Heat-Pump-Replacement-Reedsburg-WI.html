<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
