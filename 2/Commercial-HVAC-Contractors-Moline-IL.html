<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things first. Ensure all the registers in your house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The reduced air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
