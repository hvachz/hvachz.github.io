<h3>Working of an HVAC System at Kenosha WI</h3>
<p>Aerating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of exchanging or changing air in any space to provide high indoor air quality which includes temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and elimination of moisture, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne germs, co2, and other gases. Ventilation eliminates unpleasant smells and extreme moisture, presents outside air, keeps interior structure air circulating, and prevents stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
