<h3>Types of HVAC Repairs in Madison NJ</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, carried out a research study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by enhancing air flow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy performance. In many cases, measured particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a reliable company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a similar score are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
