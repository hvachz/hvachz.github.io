We had acquired the club member maintenance strategy, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to check the air conditioning unit prior to you buy. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam stated he had ways to test AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had actually understood him then.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
