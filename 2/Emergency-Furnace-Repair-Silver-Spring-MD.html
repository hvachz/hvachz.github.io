They consist of both human-made and naturally taking place chemical substances. Chemical contaminants can include tobacco smoke, emissions from products utilized in the building (e.g., office devices; furniture, flooring and wall coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer products) unintentional spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>
<p>The probability of immediate responses to indoor air contaminants depends on numerous elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 essential influences. In other cases, whether a person responds to a contaminant depends on private sensitivity, which varies greatly from person to person. Some individuals can become sensitized to biological contaminants after repeated exposures, and it appears that some individuals can end up being sensitized to chemical pollutants also.<p>
