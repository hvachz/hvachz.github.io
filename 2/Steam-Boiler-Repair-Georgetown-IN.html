<p>Your heating, air, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a range of pollutants that have the prospective to adversely impact your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungis, germs, and really small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should assess and, if needed, upgrade the structure envelope.
