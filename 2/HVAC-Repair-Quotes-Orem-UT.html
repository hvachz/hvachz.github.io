<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply 8 to 10 years old, it might grovel two times the electrical energy that even a low-end new one would use. That's because it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to provide a particular cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but nowadays, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling bills than devices set up simply a couple of years back.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Lowering pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outside) air to dilute polluted (indoor) air. Local building codes likely define the quantity (and in some cases quality) of outdoor air that should be constantly provided in your structures, as do voluntary requirements set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Temporarily increasing ventilation coupled with correct usage of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for example, can be helpful in diluting the concentration of harmful fumes in the air.<p>
