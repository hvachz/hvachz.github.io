<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many furnaces have several control boards. The largest, or just one in some heating systems, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards collaborate the operation and manage of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the brand-new control board must be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t appropriately detected, changing a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable as soon as installed.
