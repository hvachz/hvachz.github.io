<h3>Getting Through Central Heating Installation in Atchison KS</h3>
<p>The kinds of heating ventilation and a/c (HVAC) systems are as different as the various houses they serve (single household houses, duplexes, mobile houses, apartments, high-rise condominiums, row housing, and so on). No matter what the type of home HVAC system, adequate air circulation (ventilation), correct filtration, and humidity control all add to a healthy indoor air environment. > Likewise, frequent maintenance of the HVAC system will ensure that it is operating safely and not adding to or triggering an indoor air problem.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
