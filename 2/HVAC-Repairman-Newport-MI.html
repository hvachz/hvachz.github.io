Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
