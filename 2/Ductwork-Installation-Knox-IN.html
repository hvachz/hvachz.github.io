<p>Proper ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. Goettl is a growing HVAC contractor with a very old name. The company started in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature clients for decades, up until the required for high-efficiency units required Goettl to end production. The contracting side of the business continued under a number of owners.

<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task finding the outside system as near to your home as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to enjoy the video first prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had issues with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we fixed problems. I would suggest this product to anybody who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the first time.
