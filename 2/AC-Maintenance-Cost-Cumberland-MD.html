As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to appropriately service and the unit has actually been operating problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
