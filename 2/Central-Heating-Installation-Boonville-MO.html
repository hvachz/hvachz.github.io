And if the storage room has a concrete floor, place two 2x4s underneath the box to raise it up and safeguard it from moisture.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.
