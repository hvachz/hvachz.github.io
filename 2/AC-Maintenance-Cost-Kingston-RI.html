<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not provide them.. Secondly like prolonged vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with consumers fairly.

A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have.
