<p>It is still possible that an indoor air pollution problem exists if no pollutant sources are discovered. Extreme re-circulation of air causes "stale air" conditions. Stale air has higher levels of co2 and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. Stagnant air might also be a problem when ventilation is not enough to represent an increase in the number of workers in the area.<p>
<p>Energy effectiveness can be enhanced even more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This permits a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heater. Zones are controlled by several thermostats. In water heater the thermostats manage zone valves, and in forced air systems they manage zone dampers inside the vents which selectively block the flow of air.
