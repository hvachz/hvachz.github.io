<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile tube) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>It might feel comfortable being sealed in tight versus the cold in your house during the chillier months of the year, but for people who are sensitive to indoor irritants or have breathing issues, winter season can worsen problems.
