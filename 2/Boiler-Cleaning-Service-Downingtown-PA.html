<p>All Points Heating offers house cooling, a/c installation, air conditioning system maintenance that deliver reliable, proven efficiency at high effectiveness.

<p>Truth: Geothermal systems actually take in no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that very same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are extremely unusual now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact remove countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>

<p>I have been utilizing them for several years for my companies, my own houses and my realty customers' houses. I went through five other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different rates and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event.
