<p>RMI is working to change that, starting in California. As an initial step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set stronger indoor guidelines based on the most recent science for NO2.

<p>Central air is a luxury not everybody can manage, a lot of Seattleites must discover methods to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture, Air cleaning occurs. The objective is to supply enough changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical aspect essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
