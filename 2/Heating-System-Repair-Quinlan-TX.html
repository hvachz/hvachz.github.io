<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for ac system repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you should check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
