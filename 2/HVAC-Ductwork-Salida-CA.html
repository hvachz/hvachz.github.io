<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices typically lasts years, considering that it is protected indoors. When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most pricey to set up. New technical guidelines eliminate the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely.
