<p>I am extremely impressed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years back and know the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise amazed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and people; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can become reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these pollutants through the home.<p>
