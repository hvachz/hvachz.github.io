<p>I usually do not leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You don't expect having to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my choices. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over options. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid identify the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness, Air cleaning takes place. The goal is to offer enough changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A typical element required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
