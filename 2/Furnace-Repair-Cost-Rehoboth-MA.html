<p>SysTech Style concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The very same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
