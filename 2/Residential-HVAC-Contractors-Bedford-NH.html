<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Basics in Bedford NH</h3>
<p>Biological impurities: the biological impurities can consist of germs, infections, fungi (mold), allergen irritant, animal dander, insect bio sediment, fibers and fiberglass, pollen, cockroach irritant, etc. and might arise from inadequate maintenance and housekeeping, water spills, inadequate humidity control, condensation, or may be brought into the structure by residents, seepage, or ventilation air. Allergic responses to indoor biological toxin exposures trigger symptoms in allergic people and likewise play a key role in triggering asthma episodes for an estimated 15 million Americans.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
