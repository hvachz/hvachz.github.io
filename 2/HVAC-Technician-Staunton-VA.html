<p>Biological impurities: the biological impurities can include germs, viruses, fungi (mold), dust mite allergen, animal dander, insect bio sediment, fibers and fiberglass, pollen, cockroach irritant, etc. and may result from insufficient maintenance and housekeeping, water spills, insufficient humidity control, condensation, or may be brought into the structure by occupants, infiltration, or ventilation air. Allergic reactions to indoor biological contaminant direct exposures trigger signs in allergic individuals and also play a key function in activating asthma episodes for an approximated 15 million Americans.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the consistent heat distribution over the whole surface of a flooring heats the lower half of the space, enveloping occupants in heat at a lower general temperature level-- sometimes as much as 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a conventional heating unit."
