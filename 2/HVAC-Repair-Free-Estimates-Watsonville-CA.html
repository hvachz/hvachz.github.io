<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Since the 1980s, makers of HVAC devices have actually been making an effort to make the systems they make more effective.

If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be showing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount rate if she restored her PMA for 7 years, although it was 6 months before the existing one expired. She didn't need a air filtration system, but they talked her into it.<p>
