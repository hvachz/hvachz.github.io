<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you must look out for. First, you must check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
