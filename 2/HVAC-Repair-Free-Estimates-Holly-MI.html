<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not only was the price terrific but Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is usually an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
