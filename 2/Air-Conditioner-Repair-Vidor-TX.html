<p>While toxins typically found in indoor air are responsible for numerous damaging effects, there is significant uncertainty about what concentrations or durations of direct exposure are essential to produce particular health issue. People also react extremely differently to exposure to indoor air toxins. Further research is needed to much better comprehend which health results take place after direct exposure to the typical pollutant concentrations discovered in houses and which happen from the greater concentrations that happen for short periods of time.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are sent by animals and people; germs are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful allergen. It can become air-borne when it dries. Polluted central air handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these contaminants through the home.<p>
