<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible.
