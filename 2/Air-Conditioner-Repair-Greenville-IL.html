Radiant heat systems have been around given that the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipes under their marble floors and tied them into a hot water supply.

<p>A blocked furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Unclean filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your house won't warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. An unclean filter likewise causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>I have been utilizing them for many years for my companies, my own homes and my realty customers' houses. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with various costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental home. When I called and he recommended me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again, he helped me trouble shoot the issue. He is honest, reliable, and sensible on price. It's hard to find a sincere AC man and I'm happy I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
