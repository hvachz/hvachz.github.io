<h3>Heat Pump Maintenance and Tune-Ups in Dillwyn Virginia</h3>
<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems.
