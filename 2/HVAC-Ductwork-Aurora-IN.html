<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the see. They suggested changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a quick internet search validated WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the visit or the new part. I was very pleased they stood by their work and repaired the issue. Will certainly be using them again.<p>
<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his employees, devices costs, marketing, energies, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, specifically if the goal of owning an organisation was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it took to develop the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% normally isn't the end goal. HVAC company owner should pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their profits while keeping costs the same in all other areas.<p>
