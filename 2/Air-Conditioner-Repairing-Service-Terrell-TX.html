<p>We're Not Simply Another Air Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to look out for is the dust that collects during summertimes.

<p>Not all sensors work the exact same method; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're working with an Internet of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality tracking equipment will send the sensing unit data to the cloud, where you can access it through software.
