<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating equipment can last for several years. However if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel costs all of a sudden appear greater than typical, it is probably time to think about a new system.

<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the see. They suggested replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a fast web search verified WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I happily had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the see or the new part.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not offer auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money being available in every month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to offer automobile debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There ought to not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
