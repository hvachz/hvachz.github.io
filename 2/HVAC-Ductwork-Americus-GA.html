<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
