<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for modern-day ac system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the a/c boost. This boost has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c should increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The ac system's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
