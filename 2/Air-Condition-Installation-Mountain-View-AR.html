<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a fairly simple to determine surrogate for indoor contaminants given off by human beings, and associates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are unusually high indoors may trigger occupants to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the primary indoor source of carbon dioxide in the majority of buildings.

<p>Utilizing a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly lowers exposure to contaminants during cooking. Incorrect change, typically shown by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased contaminant emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame tip is blue. If you purchase a new gas range or variety, think about purchasing one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot burner that burns continually. Never utilize a gas range to heat your home. Always ensure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace remains in use.<p>
