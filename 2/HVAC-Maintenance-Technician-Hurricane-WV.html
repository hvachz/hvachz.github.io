<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, controlling the power to the heating wires and likewise controling the temperature of the flooring. All circuitry for your radiant heating system either goes to it or from it. The majority of people will install their thermostat near the entrance of the space they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the location is unobstructed and dry.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide must be adjusted regularly, and outside measurements used for calculations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors may likewise be needed.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air issues by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge contaminants.)

Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
