<p>If the condenser coils are blocked, the compressor can shut and get too hot down. You'll experience intermittent periods of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling.

Then yank the detach block (Photo 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Image 2). If the cooling service still does not work appropriately after you've cleaned the condenser coils, installed a new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in on a monthly basis, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to offer vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There need to not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
