<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was very practical in gathering information on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to momentarily handle the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and offered clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will certainly use Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and house.<p>

Nevertheless, select your contractor carefully, many of the 'trustworthy' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales strategies that DO take advantage of uninformed house owners.

There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
