<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace at Marion IN?</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current trend in house building is to lower air leakage through cracks and other openings in floors, walls, and roofs. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much higher. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor contaminants and assists exhaust them from the home.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
