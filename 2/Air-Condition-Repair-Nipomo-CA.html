Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible hose) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
