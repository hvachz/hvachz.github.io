<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
