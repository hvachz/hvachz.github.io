<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos products include vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement products. These items provide a danger only when they are dealt with in a manner that creates dust containing asbestos fibers which can be breathed in. When asbestos-containing materials are damaged or disrupted by repair, remodeling, or demolition activities, microscopic fibers can end up being airborne if appropriate controls are not in place. This can lead to the potential for significant health issue.<p>
