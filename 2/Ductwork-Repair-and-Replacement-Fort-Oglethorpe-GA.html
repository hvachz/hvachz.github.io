<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>Asthmatic kids are especially at danger. EPA estimates that exposure to pre-owned smoke increases the variety of episodes and intensity of signs in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic kids, and may cause thousands of nonasth-matic kids to establish the disease each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition made worse by exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Exposure to pre-owned smoke causes eye, nose, and throat inflammation. It may impact the cardiovascular system and some studies have actually linked direct exposure to previously owned smoke with the start of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Details Clearinghouse (IAQ INFO), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>People working in structures with poor IAQ might observe musty or unpleasant smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to excellent building management.<p>
