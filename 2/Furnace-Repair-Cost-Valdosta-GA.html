<h3>Ventilation Double Flux in Valdosta GA 31602</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Asthmatic children are particularly at risk. EPA estimates that direct exposure to pre-owned smoke increases the variety of episodes and severity of signs in hundreds of countless asthmatic kids, and may cause thousands of nonasth-matic children to develop the disease each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition intensified by exposure to secondhand smoke each year. Direct exposure to previously owned smoke triggers throat, eye, and nose inflammation. It might impact the cardiovascular system and some studies have actually connected exposure to previously owned smoke with the start of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Information Clearinghouse (IAQ INFO), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
