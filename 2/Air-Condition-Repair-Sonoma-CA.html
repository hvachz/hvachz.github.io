<h3>Working of an HVAC System at Sonoma CA</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to remove the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heating system. We picked getting something more pricey than a conventional hot water heater as gas is one of our most significant utility expenses. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>

Modification the filters regularly and have your ductwork cleaned since the soot builds up inside the ducts, reducing their efficiency with time. Anticipate to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, alter your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running efficiently.<p>
