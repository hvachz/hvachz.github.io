<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as relatively the same physical product with time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
