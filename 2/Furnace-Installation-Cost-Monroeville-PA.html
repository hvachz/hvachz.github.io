<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil.
