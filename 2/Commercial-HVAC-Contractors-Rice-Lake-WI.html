And, all of the cash you pay your energy utility companies each month could be utilized to help you spend for a new, far more energy-efficient and energy conserving furnace. Start to compare the cost of your current heating costs with heating expenses from the previous years. If there is a considerable difference, then it's time to change your furnace.<p>
