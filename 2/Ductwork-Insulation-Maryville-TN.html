<p>Remember, too, that you might want to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump systems can have different heating and cooling capabilities. If you already have a home heater, you might look for a heat pump more geared toward cooling capability and efficiency. For a higher-end design to look after your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to look for a model that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winters. The bright side is that the one major drawback of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the extremely hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise area.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for residence occupants. Unlike other types of ac system, evaporative coolers count on the outdoors air to be funnelled through cooler pads that cool the air prior to it reaches the inside of a house through its air duct system; this cooled outside air needs to be permitted to push the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to preserve and understand.<p>
