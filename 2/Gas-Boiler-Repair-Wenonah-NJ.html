<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you should inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
