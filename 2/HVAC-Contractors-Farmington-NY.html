<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for consultation and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. The possibility of instant reactions to indoor air contaminants depends upon numerous aspects consisting of age and preexisting medical conditions. In many cases, whether an individual reacts to a toxin depends on specific level of sensitivity, which varies enormously from person to individual. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to chemical or biological pollutants after duplicated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single go to, or you can sign up for a maintenance strategy with your local heating and a/c company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get a couple of maintenance gos to each year, plus another service call, a discount on parts, and usually some other advantages. Some companies offer top priority visits to their maintenance plan members.<p>
