<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based.

Portable instruments used to measure co2 should be calibrated often, and outside measurements used for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors might also be essential.<p>
