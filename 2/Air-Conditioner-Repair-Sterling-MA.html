<p>A geothermal heat pump is one of the most energy efficient techniques of heating or cooling a house. Relying on a series of liquid-filled pipes, a home can be heated up in cooler months by transferring and condensing energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperatures found simply a few feet below ground. In the summertime, the process reverses, consequently cooling a house by removing heat. Underground temperature stays constant no matter the environment, so geothermal systems provide consistent and trusted heating & cooling.<p>
<p>A/c unit can produce a great deal of water due to the fact that they eliminate moisture from the air. To get rid of this, they have an usually plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC won't work. In reality, some condensate drains have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the area. To deal with condensate problems, please see A/c Leaks Water, below.<p>
