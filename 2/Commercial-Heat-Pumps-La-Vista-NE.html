<p>Inspect these three things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in your home are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). The reduced airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the problem.<p>
