<p>Because they eliminate wetness from the air, Air conditioners can produce a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have a generally plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. Gradually, algae can block this pipe and, when it does, the AC won't work. In reality, some condensate drains have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the location. To deal with condensate issues, please see Ac system Leaks Water, listed below.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>Terrific service within 24 hours and a fair price. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and very thorough in discussing what services would be performed.

He made a few ideas of some maintenance jobs we might wish to have actually carried out in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale tactics utilized by some in the industry.<p>

The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, prior to the air is flowed back into your home.
