<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
