<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Basics in West Jefferson NC</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current pattern in home building and construction is to decrease air leakage through fractures and other openings in walls, roofings, and floors. The mix of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually led to an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much higher. This fresh make-up air helps and waters down indoor contaminants exhaust them from the home.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to protect your financial investment by only using the services of a certified contractor or a qualified representative from an organisation or retailer to do the installation. If you select to try to do it yourself, or hire a non-licensed person to do the work, in a lot of, if not all cases, you will void the guarantee for the air conditioning system. A voided warranty will not do you any great should the system fail or breakdown. Do it right from the beginning and employ a licensed person with the experience to set up the system.<p>
