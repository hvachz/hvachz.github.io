<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement.

<p>When setting up radiant heat, you need to offer major thought to the kind of flooring covering in the home. Ceramic tile works well since it performs and shops heat. Wood, vinyl and linoleum are less efficient, but work fairly well. Carpets will directly insulate the flooring from the space, reducing effectiveness, so if you want to set up carpet in a radiant-heated space, utilize a thin carpet with dense cushioning.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
