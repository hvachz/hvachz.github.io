<p>If you think a mold problem-- either because of visible development or a musty smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and check. Leaky return ducts can also present wetness. Once again, if you think a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>

With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 lot system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it indicates the amount of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
