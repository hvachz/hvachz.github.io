The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and check. Leaky return ducts can also present wetness. Once again, if you think a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
