I seem like they offer me preferential treatment, and want to pay a little more for that peace of mind.<p>

These firms may likewise require guidance on which ENERGY STAR devices is the best suited for the size of a newly constructed house.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
