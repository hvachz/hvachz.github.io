<p>We take a look at clues prior to we supply advice to change instead of repair a heater. One of the clues we look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy bills are higher year after year, we know the unit is not running effectively. It might be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more effective model, then you would be losing cash by not changing the older system.<p>
<p>The most typical type of house heater in the U.S. burns gas or propane to produce heat. With an average cost that ranges from $2,500 to $14,000 to set up, they are not the least expensive choice, however newer systems can be extremely energy effective. According to the Department of Energy, older natural gas systems typically achieve a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while more recent, extremely efficient gas furnaces can achieve AFUE ratings as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless hazardous gas. Since it is impossible to see, smell or taste, CO can eliminate you before you are aware it is in your home. At lower levels of direct exposure, CO triggers mild effects that are often mistaken for the influenza. These symptoms consist of headaches, lightheadedness, disorientation, tiredness and nausea. The impacts of CO direct exposure can vary greatly from person to person depending on age, general health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>
