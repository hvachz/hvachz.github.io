An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the inbound air is lowered, but it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same.
