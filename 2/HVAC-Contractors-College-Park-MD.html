<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as an Essential Organisation in Los Angeles. Today's heating systems are ranked 90% effectiveness or much better; it is not uncommon for a modern furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older models, which might be ranked as low as 80% effectiveness, this can imply significant cost savings in yearly heating expenses. Modern 2- and three-stage furnaces increase efficiency even further by performing at lower or higher capability depending on the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of common a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years approximately. Unscrew the old AC contactor before removing the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Image 6).<p>
<h3>AC Replacement Service in College Park Maryland</h3>
<p>As one of the most essential financial investments and tools in your home, it pays to track simply how effectively and successfully your warm air oil or gas furnace is running.

<p>Reinstall the access panel and detach block. Turn on the circuit breaker and furnace switch.

If the compressor starts but the fan does not, the fan motor is more than likely shot. Turn off the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Image 7). Reinstall the blade and protect the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan begins. If  it doesn't, you have actually offered it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
