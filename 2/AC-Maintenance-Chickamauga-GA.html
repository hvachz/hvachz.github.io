<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace service technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate great however Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
