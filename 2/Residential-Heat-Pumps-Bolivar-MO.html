<h3>HVAC Services Company in Bolivar Missouri</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech showed up right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the see. They recommended changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a fast web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the visit or the new part.
