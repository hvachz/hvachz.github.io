<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to change your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as important as a routine oil change in your car. A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps pollutants and debris in the air. Once every 3 months, Energy Star suggests replacing your filter. During high usage months, examine the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
