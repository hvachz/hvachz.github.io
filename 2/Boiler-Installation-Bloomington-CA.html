ASHRAE suggests temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity should be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to reduce mold development.<p>
