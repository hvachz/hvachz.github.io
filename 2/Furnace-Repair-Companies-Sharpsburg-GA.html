<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 rule however got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>When I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 furnaces were not working, stability Energy was fast to respond. They appeared the next day and changed two furnaces and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday till the new furnaces can heat the house. Truthfully, our home heater is complicated, Rob and his team fixed the old duct work, changed all the dampers, make the whole system work perfectly.<p>
