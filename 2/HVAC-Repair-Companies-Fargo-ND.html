<p>An indoor air toxin is a compound in the air that may affect the health of people who live in the house. Pollutants might originate from outside the home-- such as an idling car engine in an attached garage, backyard trash burning, or radon entering your house from the ground below. An air pollutant could also originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a faulty furnace, volatile natural compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted space, secondhand smoke, mold growing on damp or damp carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, family cleaning, or individual care products. Bacteria and viruses, pet dander, and bug parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system also might contribute to indoor air quality problems. Ventilation system filters that are not replaced regularly may end up being stopped up, reducing air flow volume, quality, and distribution. They likewise may end up being places for germs and molds to grow and be dispersed throughout the house. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems likewise need to be appropriately preserved to prevent bacteria and mold contamination.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For instance, people breathe out carbon dioxide, which in small amounts is not harmful, but might become hazardous if high concentrations are allowed to accumulate. Bacteria or micro-organisms might also exist within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do establish, they may spread out throughout the entire workplace or building by means of the ventilation system.<p>
