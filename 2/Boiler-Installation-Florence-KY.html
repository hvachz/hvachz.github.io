<p>The very first air conditioning system and fridges utilized combustible or harmful gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that could lead to deadly accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion house and building comfort cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
