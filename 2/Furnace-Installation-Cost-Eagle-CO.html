<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time.

Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
