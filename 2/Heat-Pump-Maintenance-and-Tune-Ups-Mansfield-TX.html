<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential buildings has become an important issue to property owners and health specialists. Indoor air pollution research studies have identified numerous impurities that can be present in indoor air. These include combustion products, unstable organic substances (consisting of formaldehyde), tobacco smoke, bioaerosols, and pesticides. Proper ventilation and removal of the sources of these contaminants are essential in preserving excellent indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Occupational direct exposure limitations utilize dose-response information which reveal the health results of repetitive direct exposure to one particular chemical. Similar information is not readily available for long-lasting, low-level exposures to a combination of impurities as holds true for IAQ issues. Currently, there is inadequate information available to predict the impacts of direct exposure to a number of potentially hazardous agents at the same time.<p>
