<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical material over time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
