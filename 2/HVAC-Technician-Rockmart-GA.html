<h3>How To Get Rid of Boiler Problems in Rockmart GA</h3>
<p>A hydronic radiant floor heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a labyrinth of pipelines installed under the floor or right within the flooring surface itself. The heat from the warm water transfers to the floor mass and after that radiates through thermal transfer to other posts with strong mass such as the walls, ceilings, furnishings and people. It does not depend on heating or moving air to transfer warmth.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
