A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation.

When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine elements. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs dealt with by experts, visit Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair today.<p>
