<p>Fact: Federal and local incentives usually total up to between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can typically make the initial rate of a system competitive with standard equipment. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per lots of heating or cooling capability, during brand-new construction (houses usually utilize between one and five loads). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per lot, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton. However, brand-new installation practices are lowering costs, to the point where the price is getting closer to standard systems under the right conditions.<p>

The heat exchanger enables air to be heated up without can be found in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct, supplying warm air to specific bedrooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
