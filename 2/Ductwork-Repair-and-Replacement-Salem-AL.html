<h3>Which Exactly Are Inverted Heat Pumps in Salem AL?</h3>
<p>A hydronic radiant floor heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a labyrinth of pipelines installed under the flooring or right within the flooring surface itself. The heat from the warm water transfers to the flooring mass and after that radiates through thermal transfer to other posts with solid mass such as the walls, ceilings, furniture and people. It does not rely on heating or moving air to move warmth.<p>
