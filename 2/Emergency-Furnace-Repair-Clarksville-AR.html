My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a tube twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet.

You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
