<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible tube) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
