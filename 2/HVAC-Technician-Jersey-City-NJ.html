As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>

Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts.
