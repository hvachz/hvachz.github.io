<p>These men have been great. At a real estate agent, I sometimes need contractors to give me a viewpoint for what work on a house might cost. Just recently I needed to contact these guys twice.

<p>If the condenser coils are clogged, the compressor can overheat and shut down. You'll experience intermittent durations of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are clean, clean them again. Shut off the power. Turn the a/c service and furnace circuit breakers in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the disconnect block (Image 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Picture 2). If the cooling service still doesn't work appropriately after you have actually cleaned the condenser coils, set up a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC won't work completely unless you do this.<p>

<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature level, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be warmed without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner area.
