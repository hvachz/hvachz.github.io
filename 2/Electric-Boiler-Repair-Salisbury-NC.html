Your AC installer will know what to try to find.<p>

<p>It prevails to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively unchanged physical product with time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
