The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of money coming in every month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to provide car debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement..
