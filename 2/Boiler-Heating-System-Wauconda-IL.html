<h3>Repair and Maintenance for Wauconda IL Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was extremely clear and fast about his inspection, guaranteeing I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
