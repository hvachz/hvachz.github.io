<p>EER represents Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your home's square video footage. They use a series of estimations based upon the British Thermal Systems or BTUs needed to heat the space. The larger the space, the more effective the house heating unit needs to be. For currently constructed home heating systems, the contractor will require to eliminate the old furnace to add the new one. These charges will be included in the installation expenses.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The objective is to offer enough modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
