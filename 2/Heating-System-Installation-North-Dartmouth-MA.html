<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace at North Dartmouth MA?</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to eliminate the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating unit. We chose getting something more pricey than a standard hot water heater as gas is one of our most significant energy expenses. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>

When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was needed and renovated the whole plenum and the duct for the water heater because the specialists thought they simply didn't seem best and they couldn't leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
