<p>Most Midtown Houston Tx customers don't understand why their HVAC system is not working when they position a 24 hour emergency ac repair request. The copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have a good concept of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you require to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is filthy, you're in luck, that's more than likely your problem. The next action is to defrost your air conditioning equipment if you discovered that your conditioning filter needs changing. The easiest method to thaw your HVAC equipment is to leave the unit off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you must examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
