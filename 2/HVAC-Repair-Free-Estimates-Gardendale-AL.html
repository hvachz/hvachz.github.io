<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical material over time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
