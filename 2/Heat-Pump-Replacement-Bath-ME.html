<h3>AC Compressor in Bath ME 04530</h3>
<p>I usually don't leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over choices. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very valuable in gathering information on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to briefly handle the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and provided clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for workplace and home.<p>
<p>We have been using Keefe's for many years and have actually always been incredibly satisfied. They provide excellent repair install and the client service is fantastic. We recently had a problem with an older unit and called to set up a day and time to have it examined. They sent out James Bell and he was great. He put in the time to describe our alternatives cost differences and was very knowledgeable expert and valuable. Pleased customers. " Mathew Licausi.<p>
