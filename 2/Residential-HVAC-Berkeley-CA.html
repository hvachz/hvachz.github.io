<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Companies in Berkeley</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, work environments and homes matters, especially since we invest most of our lives inside your home. Ac system assist to dehumidify the incoming air, however in incredibly damp environments or in cases where the ac system is extra-large, it may not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the a/c will need more energy to cool your house. A more effective option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to a lot of existing systems.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. Once I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the price great however Mark headed out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
