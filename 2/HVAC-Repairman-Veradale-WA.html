<p>When our furnace was passing away, we called 2 local companies for quotes. While both were useful and handy, Ballard Natural Gas provided us a better offer, for extraordinary service. Instead of a simple sales task, the owner of the company made a complete assessment of our heating unit and located methods we might have more even heat. He consisted of these significant but small modifications in his quote. Because of recent warmer summertimes and for ecological reasons, we decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>
<p>.
