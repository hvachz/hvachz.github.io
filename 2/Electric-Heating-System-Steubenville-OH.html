Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to correctly service and the unit has actually been operating problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
