<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might require a reference later). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4).

The female crimp adapters ought to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Image 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
