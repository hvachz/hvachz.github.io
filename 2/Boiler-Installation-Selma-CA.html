Much like other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (COP). POLICE rates how much heat a system produces or eliminates (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to produce the heating or cooling effect.
