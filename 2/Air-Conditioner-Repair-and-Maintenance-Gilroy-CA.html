<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold.

Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
