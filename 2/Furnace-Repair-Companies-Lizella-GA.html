<p>While contaminant levels from individual sources might not pose a substantial health danger on their own, a lot of homes have more than one source that contributes to indoor air contamination. There can be a serious threat from the cumulative effects of these sources. Thankfully, there are actions that many people can take both to lower the danger from existing sources and to prevent brand-new issues from taking place.
