Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and examine. Leaking return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
