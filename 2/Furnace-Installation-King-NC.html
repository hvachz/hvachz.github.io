<p>A packaged system, typically installed on the roof, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, but it is also an alternative for property owners to consider. Many times, these units consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged units are great for those seeking to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system independently, considering that the system is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are normally only readily available for larger houses due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be a great way to save money on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more pricey than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the very best choice for homeowners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
