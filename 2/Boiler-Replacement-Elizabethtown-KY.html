Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight.
