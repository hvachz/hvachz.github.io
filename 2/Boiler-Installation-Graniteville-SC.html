However, choose your contractor sensibly, a lot of the 'credible' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed house owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a trusted company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a comparable score are the very same).

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must momentarily switch back into the routine a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
