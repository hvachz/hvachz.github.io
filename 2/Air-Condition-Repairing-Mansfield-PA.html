<p>Each volume of the ASHRAE Handbook is updated every four years. The Principles Handbook consists of heating and cooling calculations.

<p>I am really satisfied with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business many years back and understand the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
