<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, managing the power to the heating wires and also controling the temperature of the flooring.

Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the area is unobstructed and dry.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that repeated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. People at particular risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and people with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
