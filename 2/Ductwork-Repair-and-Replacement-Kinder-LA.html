<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Usually the most reliable method to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate private sources of pollution or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to decrease the quantity of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is also a more cost-effective approach to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your house are noted later on in this section.<p>
<p>Just an expert can accurately diagnose why your furnace isn't starting. If at any point in the process of bleeding the furnace something appears weird or you lose self-confidence, it's time to call an expert. Likewise, if the process doesn't work, something else is incorrect and you need a technician to analyze the furnace. Even if bleeding the furnace does work, however you discover you need to do it often, it's probably time for a professional opinion.<p>
