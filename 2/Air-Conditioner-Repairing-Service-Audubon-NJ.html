<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them.. Second of all like prolonged auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed skills to do the job and also the morals to treat customers fairly. As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be totally made the most of. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly found someone to effectively service and the unit has actually been operating problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
