<h3>Heat Pump Water Heater in Corning NY 14830</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
