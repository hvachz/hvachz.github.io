<p>The split system is the most common. The majority of people are utilized to seeing this enter the backyards of homes. With split system units, the majority of the parts are housed in a metal box outside of the home. However, there are some internal parts also. Split systems are ideal for cooling several rooms simultaneously, however are not really energy efficient. Therefore, one pro is not having loud equipment in the house.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must momentarily change back into the routine a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
