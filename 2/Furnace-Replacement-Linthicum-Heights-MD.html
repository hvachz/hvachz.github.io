<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Lastly, if you do recognize a particularly energy-efficient in-floor heater and choose to install it in your house, you could be qualified for state or federal programs that can help cover your up-front contractor expenses.

<p>The cost of returning a garden location or landscaping to its previous state should likewise be thought about, and for many the idea of digging up a carefully produced location is often a significant barrier to adoption of the geothermal system, however the vertically installed loop drastically reduces this interruption, making them a feasible choice even in circumstances where space is available for the horizontal technique.<p>
