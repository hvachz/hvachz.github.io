<p>Your air, ventilation, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a variety of contaminants that have the prospective to negatively affect your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungis, germs, and very small particles of dust.

Insulation may be a more effective solution to your cooling issues than changing your equipment.<p>
<p>Air conditioning unit makers generally make rugged, high quality items. If your a/c unit stops working, start by checking any merges or breaker.
