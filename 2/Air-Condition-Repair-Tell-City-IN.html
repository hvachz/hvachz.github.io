<h3>Geothermal Heating And Cooling in Tell City IN 47586</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
