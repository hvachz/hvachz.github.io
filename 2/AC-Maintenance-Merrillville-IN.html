<p>Asbestos is a mineral fiber that has actually been used commonly in a variety of structure construction materials for insulation and as a fire-retardant. EPA and CPSC have actually prohibited numerous asbestos products. Makers have also voluntarily restricted uses of asbestos.

<p>Energy performance can be improved much more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This allows a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heating unit. Zones are controlled by multiple thermostats.

<p>Re-install the access panel and disconnect block. Turn on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and await the AC to begin (see Be Client at Startup," listed below). The compressor ought to run and the condenser fan should spin.
