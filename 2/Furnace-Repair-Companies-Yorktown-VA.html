<h3>Radiant Heating System in Yorktown VA 23693</h3>
<p>The federal government advises that houses be weatherized in order to decrease the quantity of energy required for heating and cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, steps need to also be taken to minimize pollution from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for suggested actions.) In addition, citizens should be alert to the introduction of indications of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew development. Extra weatherization procedures must not be undertaken up until these problems have actually been corrected.<p>
<p>The majority of well and city water does not usually include lead. Water usually gets lead inside the house from family plumbing that is made with lead products. The only method to know if there is lead in drinking water is to have it tested. Contact the local health department or the water supplier to learn how to get the water checked. Send out for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for additional information about what you can do if you have lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more details.<p>
<p>Indoor environments are extremely complicated and building residents may be exposed to a range of impurities (in the form of particles and gases) from office machines, cleaning items, building and construction activities, carpets and furnishings, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged building products, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), insects, and outside toxins. Other factors such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can likewise affect how people react to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>The predominant health impact connected with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might posture threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your threat of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
