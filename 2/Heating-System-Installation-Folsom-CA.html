Other aspects that can affect this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>Houses can have the same indoor air issues as single-family houses since a lot of the pollution sources, such as the interior structure materials, furnishings, and family items, are comparable. Indoor air issues comparable to those in offices are triggered by such sources as infected ventilation systems, incorrectly positioned outside air intakes, or maintenance activities.<p>

<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
