<p>Self-installation tends to create more problems than it solves. In truth, it frequently triggers professional intervention anyway to correct some of the problems that were produced during the installation.

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
