<h3>Furnace Repair Near Me in Fairfield OH 45014</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have actually become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
