<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance in Hopewell VA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was quick and really clear about his evaluation, ensuring I understood what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>There are a few possibilities to discuss short biking in really cold weather. The most obvious is the possibility of the high demands put on the system due to the extremely low temperatures. Often, the furnace will merely run more difficult to maintain a warm environment for your home when the weather is exceptionally cold. There are other possibilities such as a fracture in the heat exchanger or a broken thermostat. If you require clearness on this problem, contact one of our technicians.<p>
<p>Irritants are materials that trigger an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these materials. Allergens found in indoor air are mainly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can end up being air-borne, and thus, are quickly inhaled. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For instance, if you consider a group of individuals with asthma, the presence of feline allergen could bring on an asthma attack in people with cat allergies, however not in those people who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>
