<p>EER means Energy Performance Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air units is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ¬∞ F and an indoor temperature of 80 ¬∞ F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>
