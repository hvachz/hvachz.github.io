<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the typical home.

An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the incoming air is lowered, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the practical heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather substantial if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
