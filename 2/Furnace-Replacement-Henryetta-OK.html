<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace professionals often discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Look for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not offer them.  Second of all like prolonged car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely benefited from. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to appropriately service and the unit has actually been running issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
