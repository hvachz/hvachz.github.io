As a primary step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set stronger indoor standards based upon the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to control indoor appliances through codes, and after stronger standards are set there is an opportunity to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide need to be calibrated regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for calculations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors might likewise be required.<p>
