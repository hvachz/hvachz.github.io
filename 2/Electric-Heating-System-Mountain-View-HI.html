<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pushing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you select them up, do decline them till they have been correctly dried. If goods with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent visits, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>
