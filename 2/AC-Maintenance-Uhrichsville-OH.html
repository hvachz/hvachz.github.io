<h3>Average HVAC Services Offered with a Uhrichsville OH HVAC Company</h3>
<p>Geothermal heatpump are very efficient, since ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature is always at a constant temperature level. These systems can obtain a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can just obtain an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Just like other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (COP). POLICE OFFICER rates just how much heat a system removes or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to create the heating or cooling result. A lot of ground source heatpump have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this indicates is that for every unit of energy used by a geothermal heatpump, approximately 3 to 5 units are supplied back in the kind of heat.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
