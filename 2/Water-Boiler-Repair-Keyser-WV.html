If your contractor states they know the size of air conditioning system you need based on experience or on square video alone, transfer to another contractor. Similar to determining the size of an unit needed based upon BTUs, figuring out the correct size of unit for your house likewise depends upon the system load-- just how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>
