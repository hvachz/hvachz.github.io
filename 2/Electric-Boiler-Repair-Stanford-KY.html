<p>Professional heating system setups. However, even the best-maintained heating unit will eventually fail. HVAC experts advise following this standard rule when deciding whether it's worth investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the cost of a new system, it's best to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have many more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than essential.<p>
<p>Oil heating units are less common now than gas, but they can be helpful in more remote areas where utilities are more difficult to gain access to, and in chillier climates since it provides more heat per BTU than other options. The installation cost will be lower, but energy expenses will be higher, as much as three times higher than gas or electric heaters. They require a tank on the instant home and more maintenance. Overall, they cost between $2,000 and $8,000 to set up. In general, they offer an AFUE rating of between 80 and 90 percent.<p>
