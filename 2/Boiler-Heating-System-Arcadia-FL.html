<p>Truth: Geothermal systems really consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceptionally unusual now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really eliminate millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>2. Keep a healthy level of humidity. Allergen and mold love moisture. Keeping humidity around 30% -50% assists keep them and other irritants under control. A dehumidifier (and a/c during summertime) helps in reducing wetness in indoor air and efficiently controls allergens, Lang states. An air conditioning unit also minimizes indoor pollen count - another plus for allergy -patients.<p>
<p>A lot of central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the a/c system.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning unit works however your house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>

I appreciate the honesty. Integrity isn't just their name, it's a service design they take seriously. You people are officially on speed dial. Talk to you soon.<p>
<p>I am really pleased with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call company many years earlier and understand the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
