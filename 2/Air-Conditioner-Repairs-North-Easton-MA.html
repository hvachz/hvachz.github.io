<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
