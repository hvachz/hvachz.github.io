<p>Central air units are measured in lots. This measurement is based upon the system's capability to cool your house. For example, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 load system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it suggests the quantity of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>
