If the signs fade or disappear when an individual is away from the area, for example, an effort should be made to determine indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some results might be intensified by an inadequate supply of outdoor air coming indoors or from the heating, cooling or humidity conditions widespread inside.<p>

This implies that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also required to routinely clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately lead to damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
