<h3>HVAC Maintenance Service in Wichita Kansas</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the go to. They advised changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a fast web search verified WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning.
