The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. If your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most cost effective. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to set up an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
