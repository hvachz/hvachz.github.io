<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace service technicians frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Place the solar storage tank near the conventional hot water heater. If the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank, make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are accessible. It is likely that it is supported by the pipes if the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank. Install unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever require to be replaced.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
