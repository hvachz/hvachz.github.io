<p>A geothermal heat pump is among the most energy efficient techniques of heating or cooling a house. Depending on a series of liquid-filled pipelines, a house can be warmed in cooler months by condensing and moving energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperatures found just a couple of feet listed below ground.

<p>You could update to the highest efficiency gear available and still not feel conveniently cool on hot days. That's since the mechanicals are just part of the central air system. The typical home's ductwork leaks 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your living space, according to Pacific Gas & Electric.

<h3>Preventive HVAC Maintenance in Dripping Springs TX</h3>
<p>The types of heating ventilation and cooling (HVAC) systems are as different as the various houses they serve (single family homes, duplexes, mobile houses, apartment or condos, high-rise condominiums, row real estate, etc.). No matter what the kind of home HVAC system, appropriate air circulation (ventilation), correct filtration, and humidity manage all add to a healthy indoor air environment. > Also, frequent maintenance of the HVAC system will ensure that it is running safely and not contributing to or causing an indoor air issue.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
