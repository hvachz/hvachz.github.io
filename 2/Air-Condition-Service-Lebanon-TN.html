Considering that ductwork is so complicated, duct cleaning and duct maintenance can appear very challenging in the beginning, needing specialized tools, equipment, and know-how. When you opt for Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you won't have to stress over a thing.<p>

Generally, SEER offers more information based upon how the EER carries out in different temperatures. The greater the system's SEER ranking, the more energy efficient it is. 1 A system's SEER ranking can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all appliances.<p>
