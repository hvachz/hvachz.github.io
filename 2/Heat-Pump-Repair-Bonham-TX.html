<h3>Clogged Air Filters in Bonham Texas</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the see. They suggested replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick web search verified WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was defective.

That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with clients and keeps people working. When a sales guy pertains to your house he exists to sell, that is the only way he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and should not "need" to sell you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on.
