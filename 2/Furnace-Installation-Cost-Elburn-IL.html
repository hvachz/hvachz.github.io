<p>Prior to you head out and purchase an a/c, there are a few things to decide first. Where are you going to be setting up the air conditioner? If your house is not equipped with ductwork, do you want to set up some or go ductless? How big should the a/c unit be? Too big and you'll encounter problems with short-cycling, which can harm the a/c unit and shorten its life. Too little and your air conditioning system won't have the ability to cool the house effectively. When going shopping for a new AC system, these are simply a few of the aspects that you need to take into account. Each option can and will significantly affect your system's efficiency, which is why you can't manage to ignore any of them.<p>
<p>The split system is the most common. Most people are utilized to seeing this enter the backyards of houses. With split system units, most of the elements are housed in a metal box outside of the house. Nevertheless, there are some internal elements as well. Split systems are perfect for cooling multiple rooms at once, but are not extremely energy efficient. Therefore, one pro is not having loud devices in the house. At the very same time, the con would be that those who utilize this may spend more money on cooling costs in the long run because of the lower energy efficiency.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's supplying the service agreement attempts to upsell you every time they come to carry out regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for seven years, even though it was six months before the existing one ended. She didn't need a air filtering system, but they talked her into it.<p>
