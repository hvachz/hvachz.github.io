<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The main reason house owners do not acquire an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 annually, depending on the amount of services provided. The cost may not be rewarding if the system is new and still under a producer's guarantee. Any major repairs ought to be covered under the producer's guarantee. Nevertheless, some makers need regular maintenance as a term of the service warranty.<p>
<p>Many companies use 3rd party warranty companies - not YORK. YORK products are backed by some of the very best limited guarantees in business, consisting of YORK's factory-backed guarantee. Since these guarantees lead the HVAC industry in covering parts and essential mechanical components, you can rest assured knowing you have actually selected the very best furnace and air conditioner for your home or service.<p>
