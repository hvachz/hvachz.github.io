<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible hose) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Frequently, indoor air quality problems in big commercial buildings can not be efficiently determined or corrected without a detailed structure examination. These investigations might start with written questionnaires and telephone assessments in which building investigators assess the history of resident signs and building operation treatments. In many cases, these inquiries might quickly discover the problem and on-site visits are unnecessary.<p>
