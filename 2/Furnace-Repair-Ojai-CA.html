<p>How environment modification affects air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for contemporary a/c unit) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner increase. This boost has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit should increase its power intake by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
