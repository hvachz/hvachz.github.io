<h3>The Way to Keep Healthy Ductwork for A Healthy Home in Sun Valley CA</h3>
<p>And it's not simply downtown high- and mid-rise apartment or condos bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has seen the single-family house installation business completely turn on its head the last couple of years. Winter used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their traditionally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to approximately 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and individuals." And not just with newbies more familiar with AC living. Long time Seattle house owners are finally giving in, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to secure your investment by only utilizing the services of a certified contractor or a qualified agent from a company or retailer to do the installation. If you select to attempt to do it yourself, or work with a non-licensed individual to do the work, in most, if not all cases, you will void the service warranty for the cooling system. A voided service warranty will not do you any good ought to the system stop working or breakdown. Do it right from the get-go and hire a licensed individual with the experience to set up the system.<p>
