<p>If you work in building, demolition, painting, with batteries, in a radiator repair shop or lead factory, or your pastime includes lead, you might unwittingly bring lead into your house on your hands or clothes. You might also be tracking in lead from soil around your home. Soil extremely near to homes might be contaminated from lead paint on the outside of the structure. Soil by highways and roads might be contaminated from years of exhaust fumes from cars and trucks and trucks that used leaded gas. Use door mats to clean your feet prior to entering the home. Change your clothing before you go home and wash these clothing separately if you work with lead in your job or a pastime. Motivate your kids to play in sand and grassy locations instead of dirt which sticks to toys and fingers. Attempt to keep your kids from eating dirt, and make sure they clean their hands when they come within.<p>
