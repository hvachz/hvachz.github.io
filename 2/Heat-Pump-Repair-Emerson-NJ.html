<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you must inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
