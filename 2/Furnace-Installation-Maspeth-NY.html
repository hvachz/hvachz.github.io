<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them up until they have actually been correctly dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up. If goods with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent visits, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
