The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much higher. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor impurities and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
