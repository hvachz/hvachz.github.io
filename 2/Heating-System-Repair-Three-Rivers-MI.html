<p>If the hvac company didn't come out ahead they wouldn't use agreements.  The so called respectable companies rip off more people than the fly by night clothing. I know due to the fact that I tried to work for them. I quit due to the fact that 90% of them are scoundrels. They walk in with or without a contract and begin offering you things you do not need.
