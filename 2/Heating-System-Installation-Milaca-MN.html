<p>As a lot of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is required by all significant devices producer's to ensure your factory guarantees stay in place. In addition, the tangible outcomes of a PM is frequently difficult to quantify, as one reaction stated the cost savings in performance or repairs that were avoided. Many pieces of a furnace or a/c do not simply break at the snap of a finger, but instead is the result of repetitive use of a component that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger might fail too soon because the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and causing early degeneration, causing holes and cracks. If that client had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and protects the element.  a very helpful result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
