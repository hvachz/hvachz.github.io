<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical product over time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
