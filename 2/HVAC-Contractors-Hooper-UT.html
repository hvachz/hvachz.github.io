<p>Some HVAC professionals offer service contracts to their customers, offering regular maintenance of heating and cooling systems.

<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his workers, devices costs, marketing, energies, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not sound like much, especially if the goal of owning a business was for financial liberty. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it took to develop the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't the end goal. HVAC business owners must pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the exact same in all other areas.<p>
