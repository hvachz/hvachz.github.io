<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside unit as near to your home as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either because of noticeable development or a moldy smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source.

Leaky return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>

So perhaps a little steep on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
