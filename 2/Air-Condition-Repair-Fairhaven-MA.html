<p>The most typical type of house heating system in the U.S. burns gas or lp to produce heat. With a typical cost that ranges from $2,500 to $14,000 to install, they are not the least expensive alternative, however newer systems can be really energy efficient. According to the Department of Energy, older gas systems generally achieve a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while newer, extremely effective gas furnaces can accomplish AFUE scores as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature level, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct work, providing warm air to specific bed rooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
