<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the automobile debit, although my company does not offer car debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash being available in each month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to offer auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There need to not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
