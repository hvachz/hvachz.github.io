Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation.

There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this.
