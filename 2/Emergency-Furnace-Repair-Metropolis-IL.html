A multi-split system 56 is a conventional split system, which is divided into 2 parts (evaporator and condenser) and allows cooling or heating of numerous spaces with one external unit.

<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat increases, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level.

All objects in the hot zone reach equilibrium in temperature after the convected heat system has been running for a while, including people. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace begins and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts down.<p>
