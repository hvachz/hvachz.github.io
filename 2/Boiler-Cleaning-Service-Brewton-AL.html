<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
