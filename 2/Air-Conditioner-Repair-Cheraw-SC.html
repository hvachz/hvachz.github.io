<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to remove the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heater. We selected getting something more pricey than a standard water heater as gas is one of our most significant energy expenditures.
