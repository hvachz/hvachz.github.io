To ensure the system you select is the ideal size for your house, the Sears HVAC specialist does an electronic load calculation quote to figure out the precise type of heat and a/c system that's just right for your home-we don't simply replace it with the same size system you presently have. These computations take into account things such as the size of your house, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This action is necessary so the system isn't too small or too large-both waste energy.<p>

You'll have a water leakage if your HVAC unit is not draining appropriately. A limitation in your drain pipes triggers a water leakage. There are various places a clog can take place. One of the primary areas where obstructions start to establish is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
