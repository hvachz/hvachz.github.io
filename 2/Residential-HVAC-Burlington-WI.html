<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
