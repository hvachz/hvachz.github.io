Next, turn off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the detach block (Photo 1) and clean the condenser coils (Picture 2). If the air conditioning service still doesn't work effectively after you have actually cleaned the condenser coils, installed a new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC will not work completely unless you do this.<p>
