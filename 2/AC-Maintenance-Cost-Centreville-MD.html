<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
