<p>All modern a/c systems, even small window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or washed as conditions require. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters altered more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy expenses; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Additionally, really unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
<p>Initially make sure the air filter is tidy and in good condition if you see a decrease in heat output. Next, inspect other components of the furnace for any accumulation of dirt, dust and debris, a low-cost fix that can help increase performance. Likewise, inspect the vents and ducts for blockage. Lastly, make certain the thermostat is working and positioned appropriately.

If this happens, your thermostat will turn off the furnace prematurely and leave your house feeling cold. You may also require to inspect your insulation to make certain that warm air does not get away from your area through various openings.<p>
