I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty.

<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air issues by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit pollutants.)

Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, prior to the air is distributed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
