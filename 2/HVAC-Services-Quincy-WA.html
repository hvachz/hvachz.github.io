<p>To state there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement.

I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger.
