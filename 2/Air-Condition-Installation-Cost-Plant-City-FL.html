They weren't cheap but a fast web search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I gladly had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning.
