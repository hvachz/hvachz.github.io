<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job locating the outdoor unit as near to your house as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.)

<p>When our furnace was passing away, we got in touch with 2 local companies for quotes. While both were helpful and useful, Ballard Gas gave us a better offer, for remarkable service. Rather than an easy sales task, the owner of the company made a complete assessment of our heating unit and located methods we might have more even heat. He included these substantial but minor modifications in his quote. We decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump since of current warmer summer seasons and for environmental factors.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Reducing pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outside) air to dilute polluted (indoor) air. Local building codes most likely specify the amount (and often quality) of outside air that should be continually provided in your buildings, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Briefly increasing ventilation paired with appropriate use of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for example, can be beneficial in watering down the concentration of noxious fumes in the air.<p>
