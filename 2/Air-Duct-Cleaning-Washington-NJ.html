<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible hose) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
