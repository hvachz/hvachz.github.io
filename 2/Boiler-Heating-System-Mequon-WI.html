The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Given that pesticides can be discovered far from the site of their initial application, it is prudent to reduce the use of chemical pesticides outdoors in addition to inside. Depending on the site and insect to be managed, one or more of the following actions can be effective: use of biological pesticides, such as Bacillus thuringiensis, for the control of gypsy moths; choice of disease-resistant plants; and frequent washing of indoor plants and family pets. Termite damage can be lowered or avoided by ensuring that wood structure products do not enter into direct contact with the soil and by storing fire wood away from the house. By appropriately fertilizing, watering, and aerating yards, the need for chemical pesticide treatments of lawns can be considerably minimized.<p>
