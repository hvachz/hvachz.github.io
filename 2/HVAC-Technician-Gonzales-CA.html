<p>Using air filters can trap some of the air toxins. The Department of Energy's Energy Performance and Renewable Energy section suggests that "Air Filtering must have a Minimum Performance Reporting Worth (MERV) of 13 as determined by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation required Air filters are used to decrease the amount of dust that reaches the wet coils. Dust can work as food to grow molds on the damp coils and ducts and can minimize the effectiveness of the coils.<p>

So, make certain to choose based on how typically you will utilize your heating unit, the load that will be put on it and the frequency with which you plan on having it serviced each year.

PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have 2 separate systems (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This reduces the interior system footprint and enables each space to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems might be adjusted to provide heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioner into a heatpump While room air conditioning provides optimum versatility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is typically more costly than central air.<p>
