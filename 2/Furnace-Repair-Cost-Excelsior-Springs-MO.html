<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to maintain the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor wisely, many of the 'reliable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales strategies that DO make the most of uninformed property owners.
