<h3>The Benefits of Routine HVAC Maintenance in Glen Burnie MD</h3>
<p>Another technique to reducing the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your house is to increase the quantity of outdoor air coming inside your home. Many house heating and cooling systems, including required air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window a/c with the vent control open boosts the outdoor ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen fans that tire outdoors eliminate contaminants straight from the space where the fan lies and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
