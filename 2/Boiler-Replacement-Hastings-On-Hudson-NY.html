<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just eight to 10 years old, it could suck up to twice the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would use.

Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling costs than devices installed just a couple of years earlier.<p>
