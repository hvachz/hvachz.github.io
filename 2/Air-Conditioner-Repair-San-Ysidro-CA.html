<p>If the AC does not turn off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't emit heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can take place with time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts.

First, you ought to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
