Children may have greater exposures since they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>

<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a properly sized system, an undersize unit will not be able to cool spaces down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to run. An oversize compressor likewise costs more to run due to the fact that it just takes more electrical power to run a larger unit. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary moisture. The result is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level indicates. In fact, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>
