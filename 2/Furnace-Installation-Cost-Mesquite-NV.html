<p>To say there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the ac system back into its initial box, utilizing the dense-foam packaging product to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, location two 2x4s below the box to raise it up and secure it from moisture.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps, in addition to all other kinds of heatpump, have effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of performance, or POLICE. It's a clinical method of identifying just how much energy the system moves versus just how much it utilizes. The majority of geothermal heat pump systems have COPs of 3.0 to 5.0. This implies for each system of energy used to power the system, three to five units are provided as heat.<p>
