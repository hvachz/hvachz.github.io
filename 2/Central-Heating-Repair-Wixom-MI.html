<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives requests for consultation and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, a number of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
