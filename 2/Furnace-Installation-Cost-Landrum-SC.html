<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of various system types. Most typical are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are frequently described as simply glowing systems.

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
