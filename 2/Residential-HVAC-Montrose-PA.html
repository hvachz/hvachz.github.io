<p>If you feel like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you may not have an issue as long as your house still warms to the right temperature. The temperature level of the air produced by the heatpump will not necessarily be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it might not feel very hot.

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>Gas heating systems do include some downsides. The most significant disadvantage is also the result of the combustion procedure.

<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
