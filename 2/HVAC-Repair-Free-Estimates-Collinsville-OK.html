<p>Immediate effects might appear after a single exposure or duplicated exposures. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such immediate impacts are generally short-term and treatable. In some cases the treatment is simply eliminating the person's direct exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be identified. Signs of some illness, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might also show up not long after exposure to some indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by building, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into buildings by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
