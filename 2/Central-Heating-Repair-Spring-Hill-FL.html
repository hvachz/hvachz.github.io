Purchased a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I do not require.<p>
