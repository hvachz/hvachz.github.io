It sounds astounding, but furnace service technicians frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also.
