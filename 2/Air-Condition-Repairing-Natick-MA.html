<h3>AC Compressor in Natick MA 01760</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 rule but got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

The outside system should also be found in an open area, otherwise the heat from your home will not be successfully released outdoors and the efficiency of the entire system will drop greatly. It is extremely advisable to install the ac system units in easily accessible locations, for further maintenance throughout operation.<p>
