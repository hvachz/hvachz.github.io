<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
