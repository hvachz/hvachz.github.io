<p>Current Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
