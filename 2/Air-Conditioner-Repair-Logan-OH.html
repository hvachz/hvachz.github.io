<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air.

For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged period of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide ought to be adjusted often, and outside measurements utilized for estimations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements.
