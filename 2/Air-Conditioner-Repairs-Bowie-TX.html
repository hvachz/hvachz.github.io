<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in structures via mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and people; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. It can end up being airborne when it dries. Contaminated central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these pollutants through the home.<p>
