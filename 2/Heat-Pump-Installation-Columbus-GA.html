<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was extremely clear and fast about his inspection, ensuring I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
