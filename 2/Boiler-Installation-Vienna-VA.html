<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
