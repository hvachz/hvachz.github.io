<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are prone to cold spots", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and extremely hot beside the radiators. This usually results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to warm up the house escape out of the window. Radiant heat offers heat from the floor up throughout the space without any cold areas or stuffiness in the location being heated.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more difficult to control than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity should be kept at or below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to minimize mold growth.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays a crucial function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of processes which results in the supply and removal of air from inside a building." Those processes consist of bringing in outdoors air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the building, and moving some part of indoor air exterior. If several of these procedures are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
