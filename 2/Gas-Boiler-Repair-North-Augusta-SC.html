<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outside system as near your home as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in North Augusta SC?</h3>
