<p>Instant discounts on high-efficiency heatpump technologies are offered to equipment installers, applied at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Outstanding Client Service! Climate Pro is trusted and truly appreciated us and our circumstance. We got home one evening to a cold house. I called Climate Pro, and Warren came over that same night. Although he didn't have the required replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he could try to find and buy it the next morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was absolutely glad to have a heated home again. What's most amazing was that this all taken place throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find someone to help us right prior to a holiday, but Climate Pro came through for us. I will happily recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up frequently, they can end up being clogged with particles that can limit air flow, possibly impacting your comfort and your system's effectiveness. Dirty filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace elements and in more extreme cases cause the system to close down entirely. By contrast, examining and changing a furnace filter can normally be performed in just a few minutes, often with no tools required. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, usually mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
