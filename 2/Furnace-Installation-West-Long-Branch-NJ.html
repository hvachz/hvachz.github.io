<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the average home. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is decreased, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the sensible heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be quite significant.<p>
