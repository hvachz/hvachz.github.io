<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac systems and thermostats have integrated hold-up features. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've signed up for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts revealed and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature below the indoor temperature, and the unit doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>We look at ideas before we offer recommendations to change instead of repair a heating system. One of the ideas we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to use, or if energy expenses are greater year after year, we understand the unit is not running efficiently. It may be in best condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more effective model, then you would be losing cash by not changing the older unit.<p>
<p>Numerous AC units come with a variety of special functions that can even more improve performance and effectiveness. For example, homeowners might want to look for one that features a built-in filter light that will alert you when the air filter needs to be altered. Another popular function to try to find is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on at night to decrease energy costs even more. Naturally, more features imply higher central air conditioning costs.<p>
