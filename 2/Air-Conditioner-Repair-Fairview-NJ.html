<p>I usually don't leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You do not anticipate having to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss choices. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
