<h3>How Do Air Heat Pump Works in Siloam Springs AR?</h3>
<p>Aerating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the procedure of replacing or exchanging air in any space to offer high indoor air quality which includes temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and elimination of moisture, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne germs, co2, and other gases. Ventilation gets rid of undesirable smells and extreme wetness, introduces outdoors air, keeps interior structure air circulating, and avoids stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
