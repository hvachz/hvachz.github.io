<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a pipe twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet.

Now the "difficult part" once a year shut down the electrical power open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the elements, close up the cabinet returned on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
