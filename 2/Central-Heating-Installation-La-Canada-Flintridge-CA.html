<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet.

However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
