<p>Immediate discount rates on high-efficiency heat pump technologies are available to equipment installers, used at the wholesaler or supplier point-of-purchase. Outstanding Customer Service! Environment Pro is trustworthy and genuinely appreciated us and our circumstance. We got back one evening to a cold home. I called Climate Pro, and Warren came over that exact same night. Although he didn't have actually the needed replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he could look for and acquire it the next morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was absolutely grateful to have a heated house once again. What's most amazing was that this all happened during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd discover someone to help us right before a vacation, but Climate Pro came through for us. I will gladly suggest this company to my pals.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. When I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done.

I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I believe any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
