<p>The contaminants noted in this guide have actually been shown to trigger the health impacts discussed. However, it is not always true that the effects noted take place at the pollutant concentration levels normally discovered in the house. In most cases, our understanding of the toxins and their health effects is too restricted to figure out the levels at which the listed results might happen.<p>
<p>While toxins typically found in indoor air are responsible for numerous damaging effects, there is considerable unpredictability about what concentrations or durations of direct exposure are needed to produce particular health problems. People likewise respond very differently to direct exposure to indoor air contaminants. More research is needed to better understand which health results take place after direct exposure to the average toxin concentrations found in houses and which happen from the greater concentrations that occur for short periods of time.<p>
<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly the same physical product gradually. In fact, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
