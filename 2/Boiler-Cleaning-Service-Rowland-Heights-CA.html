<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outdoor unit as close to your home as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>HVAC Furnace Air Filters - Things You Must Know Before Buying in Rowland Heights CA</h3>
<p>Another method to reducing the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your home is to increase the amount of outside air coming inside your home. Most house heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window a/c with the vent control open boosts the outside ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen area fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of pollutants straight from the space where the fan lies and likewise increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is usually an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
