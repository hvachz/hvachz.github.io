The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system. A ducted heat pump system might be most cost effective if your home or building has an existing duct system that remains in good condition. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the need to set up a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

Too large and you'll run into issues with short-cycling, which can damage the a/c unit and reduce its life. Too small and your air conditioner won't be able to cool your home appropriately. When going shopping for a brand-new AC system, these are just a few of the factors that you require to take into account. Each choice can and will considerably affect your system's efficiency, which is why you can't pay for to disregard any of them.<p>
