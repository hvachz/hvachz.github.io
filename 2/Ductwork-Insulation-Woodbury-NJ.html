<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c unit works however your home doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>

<p>Four Seasons has set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have found them to be fairly priced, timely and do fine work.

No additional charge.<p>
