<p>For every single load of laundry you dry, that wetness has to go someplace. If your clothes dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply requesting mold buildup, says Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, switching from fragranced to fragrance-free products can be a straightforward and efficient  approach to lower ambient air contamination and possible health threats, according to a 2018 research study in the journal Air Quality, Atmosphere & Health.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air problems by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often give off pollutants.)
