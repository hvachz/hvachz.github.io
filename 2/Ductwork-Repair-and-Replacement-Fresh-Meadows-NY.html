Typically this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, specifically if the goal of owning a service was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it took to construct the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't the end objective. HVAC company owner need to pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping expenses the very same in all other areas.<p>
