<p>The effects of lead direct exposure on fetuses and kids can be serious. They consist of hold-ups in psychological and physical development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Infants, fetuses, and kids are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than adults given that lead is more easily absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more sensitive to the destructive impacts of lead. Children might have greater direct exposures since they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>

If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>EER means Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning units is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.

For instance, a heat exchanger might stop working prematurely because the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing premature degeneration, causing cracks and holes. If that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and secures the component.  a very useful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that potentially saved a customer thousands.<p>
