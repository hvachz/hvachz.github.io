<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to discover an area that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Because it tires warm air out the top, don't put the condenser under a deck or completely enclose it. Any air flow limitation will decrease the system's effectiveness. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely circulate around it.<p>
<p>Our technicians are trained, experienced and certified to install, preserve and repair residential and commercial air, ventilation and heating conditioning devices and to tidy and inspect your chimney or ventilation shaft. Our group does excellent work, whether it's managing standard HVAC work or handling the peculiarities of brownstones, other structures and prewar structures not easy to heat or cool.<p>
<p>Remember, too, that you might wish to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heat pump units can have different heating and cooling capabilities. You may look for a heat pump more geared towards cooling capability and effectiveness if you currently have a house heating system. For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to look for a model that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winters. The good news is that the one significant drawback of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the cold or very hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise location.<p>
<p>Advanced styles of brand-new houses are beginning to include mechanical systems that bring outdoor air into the house.

For more information about air-to-air heat exchangers, call the Preservation and Renewable Resource Questions and Referral Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>
