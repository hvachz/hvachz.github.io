<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the rate excellent however Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>4 Seasons has set up both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have found them to be fairly priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was essential and renovated the whole plenum and the duct for the hot water heater because the specialists believed they simply didn't appear best and they couldn't leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
