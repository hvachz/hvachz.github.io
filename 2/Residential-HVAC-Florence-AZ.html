<p>Air pollutants can range from pollutants brought in from the outdoors by your animals to dangerous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide gas is a common air contaminant arising from natural gas that escapes into your home without being burnt. Older homes may consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when released into the air. In bathrooms and kitchen areas, mold and mildew can become a nuisance where moisture levels are generally greater than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos items include vinyl asbestos flooring tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items. When they are managed in a way that develops dust including asbestos fibers which can be inhaled, these products present a danger only. When asbestos-containing products are harmed or disturbed by repair, renovating, or demolition activities, tiny fibers can become air-borne if correct controls are not in place. This can lead to the potential for significant health problems.<p>
