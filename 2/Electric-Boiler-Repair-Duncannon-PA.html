<h3>Furnace Cost in Duncannon Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>Some health results may show up soon after a single exposure or repeated direct exposures to a contaminant. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such instant effects are generally short-term and treatable.

Soon after exposure to some indoor air toxins, signs of some illness such as asthma may appear, be exacerbated or gotten worse.<p>
