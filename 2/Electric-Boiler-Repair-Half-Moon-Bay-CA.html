<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heating systems are still commonly utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>There are many actions a house owner can require to select products that will prevent indoor air issues from occurring - a number of them are pointed out here.

Second of all, if you prepare to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, particularly concrete in basements, make sure that an efficient moisture barrier is installed prior to setting up the carpet. Do temporarily adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be removed if it ends up being wet.<p>
