Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

From the most fundamental, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter often in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all require some standard maintenance. These filters assist with indoor air quality by trapping airborne contaminants streaming through your system. They can likewise keep your system carrying out well by helping reduce the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from building up on internal parts like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Brian was every bit honest, responsive and pleasant. Jeremiah Bartula the plumbing discussed our options prior to our work with Brian and was amazing, practical and useful - his work was flawless!
