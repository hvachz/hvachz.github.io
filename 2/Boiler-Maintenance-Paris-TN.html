<p>The main problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, workers attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system creates more difficulties, since some of indoor units can be located far from the outside.
