<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid determine the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness, Air cleaning happens. The objective is to provide adequate modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this. A common component required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
