<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. When I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the cost great but Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
