<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
