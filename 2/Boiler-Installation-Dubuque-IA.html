<p>Biological contaminants consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transferred by people and animals; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful allergen. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Contaminated central air handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these pollutants through the home.<p>
