<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, throat, and nose and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is likewise evidence from animal research studies that duplicated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. People at particular risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and individuals with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures via mechanical and natural ventilation.

<p>The primary health effect associated with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may position dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year.
