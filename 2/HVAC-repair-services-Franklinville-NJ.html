<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>They were fantastic! So many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to offer you with the service initially asked for.

The also immediately followed up with the necessary inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
