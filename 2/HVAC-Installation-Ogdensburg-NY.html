<h3>How to Install a Duct Fan to Lower Heating and AC Bills in Ogdensburg NY</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The existing pattern in home building is to decrease air leak through cracks and other openings in walls, floorings, and roofing systems. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually led to a boost in indoor air issues.

<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (for the most part) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI safeguarded.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
