<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must momentarily switch back into the routine a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
