<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

Such information can often be acquired by requesting copies of air monitoring information from the employer. If monitoring data is not readily available, yet a high variety of health symptoms have been reported, the Union agent ought to ask for that the employer have air monitoring tests performed. Review of this data may identify possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. Nevertheless, when impurity concentrations are extremely low, keeping track of information might not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
