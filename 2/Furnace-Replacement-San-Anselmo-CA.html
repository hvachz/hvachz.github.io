<p>New a/c usually range from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A greater SEER ranking indicates higher energy effectiveness and potentially lower energy costs.

<p>Because pesticides can be found far from the site of their initial application, it is sensible to lower the use of chemical pesticides outdoors in addition to indoors. Depending upon the site and pest to be controlled, several of the following actions can be efficient: use of biological pesticides, such as Bacillus thuringiensis, for the control of gypsy moths; selection of disease-resistant plants; and regular washing of indoor plants and family pets.
