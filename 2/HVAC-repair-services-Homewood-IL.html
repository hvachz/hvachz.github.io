Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the unit sits. I feel like they give me favoritism, and want to pay a little bit more for that comfort.<p>
<p>The growing interest in clever houses, in which heating and a/c systems can be controlled from another location, could be another potential opportunity for sales. According to the marketplace research company Statista, family penetration in the U.S. smart home market is already at 33 percent and is expected to reach 54 percent by 2023. A service plan for an HVAC company that plans to pursue this avenue needs to reveal a high level of knowledge about smart house HVAC products and consumer adoption.<p>
