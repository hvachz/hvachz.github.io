<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets requests for assessment and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. Nevertheless, a number of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item.
