<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system".

The outdoor condenser unit likewise switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
