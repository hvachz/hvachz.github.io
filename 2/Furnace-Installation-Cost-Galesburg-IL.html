<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily change back into the regular cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
