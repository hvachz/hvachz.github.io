<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may need a recommendation later on). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
