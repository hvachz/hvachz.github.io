<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for ac system repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you need to inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
