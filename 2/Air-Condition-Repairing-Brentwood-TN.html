<p>Devices costs are driven by the type of furnace at the heart of your house heater. Low-efficiency models will cost less, however result in higher energy bills. High-efficiency designs cost more, but save more over the long haul. Costs for gas furnaces range from $1,360 for the low-efficiency designs as much as $12,500 for high-efficiency models. Electric heaters begin at $395 and range approximately $1,700 or more depending upon the brand and furnace size.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps just as important when it pertains to central air costs, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too large will have an easy time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not have the ability to correctly cool the house on hot days. Thinking about bigger units cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
