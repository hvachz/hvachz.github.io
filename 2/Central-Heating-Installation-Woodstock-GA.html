<p>Remember that the SEER ranking is computed utilizing the same set of temperatures throughout the board. The typical summertime temperature to come to the SEER ranking is 83 degrees, so to arrive at the correct SEER score for your location, subtract 2 points for every single 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER score has to be at least 13 for all new a/c units manufactured in the United States.<p>
<p>EER stands for Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is taken in from inside your home and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you must watch out for. First, you need to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
