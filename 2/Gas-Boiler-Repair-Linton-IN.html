<p>Radiant heating covers a range of various heater, including electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on similar principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by distributing warm water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the space.<p>

The huge bulk of these units are mixed-use or multi-family, where air conditioning is more of an industry standard, says Scott Vollmoeller of engineering company Glumac.<p>

<p>While radon in water is not an issue in homes served by the majority of public water supplies, it has been found in well water. If you have actually tested the air in your home and found a radon issue, and you have a well, contact a laboratory licensed to measure radiation in water to have your water evaluated. Radon issues in water can be readily repaired. Call your state radon office or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to find out more.<p>
<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are susceptible to cold areas", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and really hot beside the radiators. This generally leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to heat up your home escape out of the window. Radiant heat supplies warmth from the floor up throughout the space with no cold spots or stuffiness in the location being warmed.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in buildings with poor IAQ might observe undesirable or musty smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are getting worse, speak to your doctor about them. However not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to excellent building management.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you may pick to replace the outside compressor with a contemporary, high-efficiency system. Seek advice from a local heating and cooling contractor to assure that the brand-new compressor is effectively matched to the indoor unit if you do so. Nevertheless, considering recent changes in refrigerants and a/c styles, it may be better to change the entire system.<p>
