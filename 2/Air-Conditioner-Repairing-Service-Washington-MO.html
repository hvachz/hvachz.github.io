<p>Central air units are measured in loads. This measurement is based on the unit's capability to cool your house. For example, a 1 lot system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it suggests the quantity of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Ask about training and accreditations. A good location to start is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) certification. It's sort of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, however a lot of contractors out there have not bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by trying to find Structure Performance Institute (BPI) certification. Supervisors with BPI accreditation understand that the house is a system and see HVAC equipment as simply one component (out of numerous) of a comfy environment.<p>
<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO maintain the performance and performance of your HVAC system, numerous research studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor wisely, much of the 'reliable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales techniques that DO make the most of uninformed property owners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a trustworthy company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a similar rating are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
