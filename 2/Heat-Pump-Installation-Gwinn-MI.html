<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets ask for consultation and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. However, much of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
