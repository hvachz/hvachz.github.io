<p>The function of many structure ventilation systems is to bring in sufficient fresh air for occupant comfort while managing temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and developing safety at affordable energy costs. Load determining is referred to as the Manual J computation and need to be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to giving an installation or system cost for a/c. If your contractor says they know the size of air conditioning system you require based upon experience or on square video footage alone, move to another contractor. As with measuring the size of a system needed based on BTUs, figuring out the correct size of unit for your home also depends upon the system load-- just how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>
