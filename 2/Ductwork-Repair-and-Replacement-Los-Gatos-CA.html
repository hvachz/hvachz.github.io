<h3>Air Condition Service in Los Gatos CA 95032</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
