<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the average home. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the incoming air is decreased, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the sensible heat of the going into air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be rather significant.<p>
