<p>When the heatpump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was really practical in collecting details on the phone and providing clear directions about how to temporarily deal with the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and used clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will definitely use Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and house.<p>
