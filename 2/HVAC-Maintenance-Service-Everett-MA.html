Yearly furnace service may also be a requirement to keep your furnace service warranty valid also. Numerous makers state on guarantee paperwork that installation and maintenance by a certified HVAC company belong of the guarantee conditions. When you have a ten-year parts minimal warranty as is standard on Carrier Â® heating systems, you'll wish to make sure you keep that coverage legitimate for the full 10 years.<p>

A voided warranty will not do you any good must the system fail or malfunction. Do it right from the start and hire a licensed person with the experience to install the system.<p>
