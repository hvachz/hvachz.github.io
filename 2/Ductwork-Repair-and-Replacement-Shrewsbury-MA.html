<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not provide auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in each month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to offer car debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
