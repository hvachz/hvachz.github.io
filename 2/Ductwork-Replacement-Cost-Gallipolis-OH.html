Pressed wood items made for indoor use consist of: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in kitchen cabinetry and furniture); hardwood plywood paneling (used for decorative wall covering and used in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiber board (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops). Medium density fiber board contains a greater resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood item and is usually recognized as being the greatest formaldehyde-emitting pushed wood item.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Biological pollutants include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transmitted by individuals and animals; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. It can end up being airborne when it dries. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these contaminants through the house.<p>
