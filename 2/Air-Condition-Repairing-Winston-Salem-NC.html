<p>How environment change affects air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for contemporary air conditioning system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the a/c unit increase. This boost has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit should increase its power usage by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
