What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my choices. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss options. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
