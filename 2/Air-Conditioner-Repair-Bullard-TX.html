<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise changes functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
