<p>A split air conditioning system consists of 2 main parts - a compressor situated outside and a within air outlet system. Unlike a system that requires a series of ductwork networked throughout the ceiling, divided air conditioners rely on a set of pipes to connect the outside to the inside air unit which is why there are described as a ductless mini-split air conditioning unit installation Refrigerant is distributed through the copper pipes that cycle through the system to produce either cold or heated air.<p>
