<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

For example, a heat exchanger might fail too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and causing early deterioration, resulting in fractures and holes. If that customer had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the component.  a very advantageous result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a client thousands.<p>
