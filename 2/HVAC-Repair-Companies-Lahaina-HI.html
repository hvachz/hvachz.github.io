<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your home at optimal effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will require a much bigger AC unit than a smaller sized house, which will affect installation costs. Likewise a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air circulation will require far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfortable. Other aspects that can impact this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
