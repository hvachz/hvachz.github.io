<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise because 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one constraint: their overall power needs to not go beyond the capacity of the outside system. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor systems greater than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to anticipate better performance when all indoor units are switched on at the exact same time, since the overall capability of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outside system.

If your home currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a relatively simple process. Setting up a new gas furnace system can be rather expensive if you are including on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>
