<p>There are lots of actions a house owner can take to select products that will avoid indoor air issues from happening - a number of them are discussed here. Initially, use exterior-grade pushed wood items made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floors, cabinets, and wall surfaces. Or, as an alternative, think about utilizing strong wood items. Secondly, if you plan to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, make sure that a reliable moisture barrier is installed prior to installing the carpet. If it ends up being damp, do not completely adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated.<p>
