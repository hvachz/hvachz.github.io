<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heating systems are still extensively used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you should inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
