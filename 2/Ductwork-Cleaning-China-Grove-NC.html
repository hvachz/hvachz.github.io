<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO maintain the performance and performance of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. Nevertheless, choose your contractor sensibly, much of the 'respectable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales techniques that DO benefit from uninformed property owners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a trustworthy company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air due to the fact that my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung around troubleshooting the issue, all the while describing everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working effectively. He had to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
