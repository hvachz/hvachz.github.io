<p>Radiant heat covers a range of various heater, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by distributing hot water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
