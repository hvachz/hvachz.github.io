<p>I am extremely impressed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call company many years back and understand the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year.

They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount rate if she renewed her PMA for seven years, although it was 6 months before the existing one expired. She didn't need a air filtering system, but they talked her into it.<p>
