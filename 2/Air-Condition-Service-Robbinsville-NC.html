<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost terrific but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

As a primary step, in April RMI affirmed prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set more powerful indoor guidelines based on the most current science for NO2.
