<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Unclean filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too rapidly, and your home will not heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. An unclean filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

There are policies in France and in Germany, and various voluntary ecolabels and rating systems including low VOC emissions requirements such as EMICODE, 19 M1, 20 Blue Angel 21 and Indoor Air Comfort 22 in Europe, as well as California Requirement CDPH Area 01350 23 and a number of others in the U.S.A..

<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to change your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as crucial as a regular oil modification in your automobile. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, tidy filter better traps pollutants and particles in the air. When every three months, Energy Star recommends changing your filter. During high usage months, inspect the filters at least month-to-month.<p>
