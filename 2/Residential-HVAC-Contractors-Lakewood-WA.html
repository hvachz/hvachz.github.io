The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the flooring are required to resist existing, which then generates heat.<p>
<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are vulnerable to cold spots", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and extremely hot beside the radiators.
