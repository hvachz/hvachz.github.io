<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heating systems are still commonly used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>Not all sensing units work the very same method; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're working with an Internet of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality monitoring devices will send the sensor information to the cloud, where you can access it via software. You get instant, real-time access to the tracking results by means of a dashboard, which turns the data into visual charts that are easy to understand.<p>
