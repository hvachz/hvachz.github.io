<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just eight to ten years old, it could flatter twice the electrical energy that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's since it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to supply a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling bills than devices set up just a few years back.<p>

<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is usually a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
