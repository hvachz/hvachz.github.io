<h3>Turning to the Ideal Company for the Ideal Furnace Repair in Waukegan IL</h3>
<p>Integrity Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on various house efficiency upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.)

We never ever felt rushed and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's product and services was outstanding. Taylor assisted us narrow the scope to a reasonable level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while allowing me to carry out the necessary electrical improvements to save on cost.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
