<p>An undersize unit won't have the ability to cool spaces down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate due to the fact that it needs to run longer than a correctly sized unit. Due to the fact that it just takes more electrical power to run a larger system, a large-scale compressor also costs more to run. And an oversize unit does not lower humidity efficiently.
