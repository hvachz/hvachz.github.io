<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average home. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is lowered, but it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the getting in air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the results can be quite significant.<p>
