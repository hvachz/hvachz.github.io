<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his staff members, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay.

<p>Indoor contaminants. These include chemicals utilized in the building or renovation of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Insufficient combustion and bad ventilation of these appliances (cook ranges, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can add to indoor pollutants.
