<p>People operating in buildings with poor IAQ might notice undesirable or musty smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no alternative to great structure management.<p>
