<p>While these actions will assist to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that only a skilled HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to expensive compressor failure, but a homeowner does not have the tools or abilities essential to check refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and appropriate air flow are important to a well-functioning system, but property owners lack the needed equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still needed to have an expert technician inspect the system regularly.<p>
<p>Mobile houses are typically smaller than stick-built properties and use substantially less oil and a much smaller sized furnace to heat.

<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you may choose to replace the outside compressor with a modern, high-efficiency unit. If you do so, speak with a local heating and cooling contractor to ensure that the brand-new compressor is effectively matched to the indoor unit. However, considering recent changes in refrigerants and a/c styles, it might be better to change the entire system.<p>
