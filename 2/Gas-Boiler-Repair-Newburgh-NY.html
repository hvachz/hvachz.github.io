<h3>Central Heating Repair in Newburgh NY 12550</h3>
<p>I generally don't leave evaluations however wished to share my experience. You don't expect having to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my choices. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about options. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
