<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs silently and effectively, but to have two major components fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing prior to work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just 8 to 10 years old, it could grovel two times the electricity that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's because it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to supply a particular cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however nowadays, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling costs than devices set up simply a couple of years back.<p>

<p>EER stands for Energy Performance Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.
