<p>A geothermal heater is more trustworthy than options, and is not affected by any external aspects, unlike other renewable energies such as wind energy and solar energy.

Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the sun nor the wind, but instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is always hot. This makes geothermal heating a reliable and offered source of energy.<p>
