<h3>Ductless Air Conditioning For Price UT Homes With No Air Ducts</h3>
<p>In the last several years, a growing body of clinical evidence has suggested that the air within homes and other buildings can be more seriously polluted than the outdoor air in even the biggest and most industrialized cities. Other research suggests that individuals spend around 90 percent of their time inside. Therefore, for many individuals, the dangers to health might be greater due to direct exposure to air contamination inside than outdoors.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

In addition, drafts caused by excessive air circulation ought to be avoided.
