<p>Specific immediate impacts resemble those from colds or other viral illness, so it is often challenging to determine if the signs are an outcome of exposure to indoor air pollution. For this reason, it is very important to take notice of the time and place the symptoms occur. If the signs fade or go away when an individual is far from the house and return when the person returns, an effort needs to be made to recognize indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some impacts may be made worse by an inadequate supply of outside air or from the heating, humidity, or cooling conditions prevalent in the house.<p>
<p>Mentioning air, radiant heat systems tend to improve indoor air quality. This is because required air heating systems distribute airborne contaminants throughout the house throughout operation, provoking a range of various negative results. Radiant heating systems don't flow air at all, which in fact enhances your indoor air quality by limiting your exposure to high levels of airborne impurities.<p>
<p>If your ac system is old, think about buying an energy-efficient model. Search for the ENERGY STAR Â® and EnergyGuide labels - certified central systems have to do with 15% more efficient than standard models. New residential central air conditioner standards went into effect on January 1, 2015; see the efficiency standards for central air conditioners for information, and consider buying a system with a higher SEER than the minimum for greater savings.<p>
