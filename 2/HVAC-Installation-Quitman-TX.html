<p>Truth: Geothermal systems in fact take in no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are extremely unusual now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really remove countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>In a packaged central air conditioning conditioner, the compressor, evaporator, and condenser are all situated in one cabinet, which usually is placed on a roofing system or on a concrete piece beside the house's structure. This type of air conditioning system also is used in small commercial buildings. Air supply and return ducts originate from inside your home through the home's exterior wall or roof to connect with the packaged a/c unit, which is generally situated outdoors. Packaged a/c unit often include electric heating coils or a gas furnace. This mix of a/c and central heater gets rid of the need for a different furnace indoors.<p>

<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is a colorless, odor-free gas that interferes with the shipment of oxygen throughout the body. At high concentrations it can cause unconsciousness and death.
