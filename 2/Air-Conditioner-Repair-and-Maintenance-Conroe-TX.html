<p>These concepts-- and desire to suffer through the heat-- may currently be changing. Though just 33 percent of Seattle housing units had air conditioning in 2015, more than 46,000 new real estate units have been built in the 4 years since or are currently under construction.

<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as designed. Moisture management and humidity control might contravene efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply cosmetics air at lower temperatures (design levels), rather of the greater temperatures sometimes utilized to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, throughout most of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require more cooling to provide thermal comfort inside. However, high humidity outdoors produces the need for mindful attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities generate mold growth and wetness indoors is associated with a greater prevalence of occupant breathing issues.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they use air to exchange heat, in the same way as an automobile radiator or typical home ac system does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which needs to be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outdoors air.<p>
