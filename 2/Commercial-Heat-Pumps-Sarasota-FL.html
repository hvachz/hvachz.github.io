<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the typical home. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the incoming air is lowered, but it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather significant if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
<p>A SEER ranking represents Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio. The SEER rating of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperatures during the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input during the very same period.

The greater the unit's SEER score, the more energy efficient it is. 1 A system's SEER ranking can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all home appliances.<p>
