<h3>Advantages of Servicing Your Central Heating Boiler in Ridgefield WA</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transferring the soaked up heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is typically a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
