<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
