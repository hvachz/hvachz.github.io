<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>What to Search for When Selecting an West Milton OH HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to remove the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating unit. We chose getting something more costly than a standard water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy expenses. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Since it has to run longer than a properly sized unit, an undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to operate. Since it just takes more electricity to run a larger unit, an oversize compressor also costs more to run. And an oversize system does not lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off prior to it has a chance to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary wetness. The outcome is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature level indicates. In fact, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>
