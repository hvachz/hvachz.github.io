<p>Today, millions of dust mites, dead skin cells, building debris, and mold might be residing in your home's duct, affecting the air you breathe as well as the effectiveness of your heating and air conditioning system.

Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a threat to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a current study by the Consumer Reports National Proving Ground. However a number of the important things people do-- or don't do-- can add to the stew of air-borne contaminants in their houses and intensify asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas.

<h3>The Benefits of Routine HVAC Maintenance at Pine Grove PA</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transferring the soaked up heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have actually discovered them to be reasonably priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was required and redid the entire plenum and the duct for the water heater since the service technicians thought they simply didn't seem best and they could not leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
