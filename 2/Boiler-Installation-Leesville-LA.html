<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to offer your house that best temperature level all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining some of those typical air contaminants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can result in costly repairs down the roadway. So, be sure to change your AC filters regularly, or get a cooling service strategy which usually includes a filter modification - especially if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays a crucial function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of processes which results in the supply and elimination of air from inside a structure."

If several of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
