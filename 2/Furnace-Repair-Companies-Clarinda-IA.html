<p>Geographically, some areas pay consistently higher incomes for air conditioning tradesmen. This might be due to high cost of living, remoteness, unfavorable climate, or just a high level of competitors for knowledgeable trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the country's highest typical incomes for HVAC technicians at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 each year. The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 per year. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 annually. Massachusetts and Connecticut completed the five highest-paying states, at $26.62 and $26.59 per hour or $55,380 and $55,310 annually.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your home that perfect temperature level all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing some of those common air contaminants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not just does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it likewise uses down your AC system, which can result in pricey repairs down the road. So, make sure to alter your AC filters frequently, or get an a/c service strategy which normally consists of a filter modification - specifically if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transmitted by individuals and animals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent irritant. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Infected central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these contaminants through the house.<p>
