<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Advanced ventilation systems that allow greater air flow from the outside, air quality monitoring platforms and sensors, and brand-new air purification technologies are becoming more common as readily available services in commercial and residential HVAC item bundles.

<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They provide me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended warranties or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
