<p>As many of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is required by all significant equipment maker's to ensure your factory service warranties remain in location. Moreover, the tangible outcomes of a PM is frequently difficult to measure, as one response stated the savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. Most pieces of a furnace or air conditioner don't just break at the snap of a finger, but instead is the result of recurring use of a part that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely since the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering early deterioration, resulting in holes and fractures. If that customer had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and secures the part.  a very useful result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
