<p>I generally don't leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my options. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about alternatives. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pressing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them until they have been effectively dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up. If items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
