<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the cost fantastic but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the total air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
