He included these substantial however minor modifications in his quote. Since of current warmer summer seasons and for ecological factors, we decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>
<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
