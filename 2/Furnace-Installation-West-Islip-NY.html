<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, classroom or lab environments, instead of outdoor or commercial settings. In tasks where union membership is not an issue, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

It might also include the installation of registers where the ductwork links to specific spaces.<p>
<p>Radiant heat offers a number of special benefits over forced air heating unit. For example, radiant heat systems are more energy efficient than forced air systems. They do not need to fret about duct leaks, which are responsible for output losses of approximately 30% in other heating unit types.
