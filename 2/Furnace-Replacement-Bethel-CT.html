<h3>Heating System Repair in Bethel Connecticut</h3>
<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a moldy odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and keep. Leaky return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
