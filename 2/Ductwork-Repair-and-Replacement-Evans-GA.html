<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in loads. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 heap unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs.

<p>These people have actually been excellent. At a realtor, I often require contractors to give me an opinion for what work on a house might cost. Recently I needed to contact these men two times. They came out quickly and provided me a no nonsense quote for the work. Even when it was news my customer probably would not wish to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the sincerity. Stability isn't simply their name, it's a service model they take seriously. You people are officially on speed dial. Talk with you soon.<p>
