In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for contemporary air conditioning unit) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning system increase. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c should increase its power usage by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
