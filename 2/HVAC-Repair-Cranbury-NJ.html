Appropriate ventilation and removal of the sources of these impurities are necessary in preserving great indoor air quality.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Add To Air Quality Issues. HVAC systems can likewise worsen indoor air quality problems. The HVAC system might be contaminated (because of mold in duct lining or bacteria on coil or filters, for example), and the system may spread out these pollutants throughout the house.
