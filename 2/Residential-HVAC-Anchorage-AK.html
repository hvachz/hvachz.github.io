<p>Terrific Product! Delivery was kind of odd being that package was opened and products could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all intact. The item was very lite weight and requires time to apply. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to see the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets.
