Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>

<p>Integrity Energy was quick to react when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 heaters were not working. They appeared the next day and changed two furnaces and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday till the new furnaces can heat your house. Honestly, our home heating unit is complicated, Rob and his team repaired the old duct, altered all the dampers, make the whole system work perfectly.<p>
<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a brand-new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended service warranties or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I don't require.<p>
