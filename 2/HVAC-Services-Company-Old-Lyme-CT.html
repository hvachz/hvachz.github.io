<p>I have been utilizing them for several years for my organisations, my own homes and my real estate clients' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different rates and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who described to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another occasion. He helped me problem shoot the issue when I called and he encouraged me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working once again. He is honest, trusted, and affordable on price. It's hard to find a truthful AC guy and I'm thankful I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
