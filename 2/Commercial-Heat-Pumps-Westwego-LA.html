<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you must inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
