<p>If the condenser coils are blocked, the compressor can shut and get too hot down. You'll experience periodic durations of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are clean, tidy them once again. Shut off the power. Turn the a/c service and furnace breaker in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, switch off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then tug the disconnect block (Photo 1) and clean the condenser coils (Picture 2). If the air conditioning service still does not work properly after you've cleaned up the condenser coils, set up a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC will not work fully unless you do this.<p>
