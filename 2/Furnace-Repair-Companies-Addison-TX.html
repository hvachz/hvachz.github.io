<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may require a recommendation in the future). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
