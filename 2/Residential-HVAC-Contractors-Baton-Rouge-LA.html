<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act just like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system. If your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most affordable. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the need to set up an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>5. Odor great naturally. You might associate that lemony or piney aroma with a clean kitchen or tidy synthetic scents in laundry products and air fresheners produce lots of different chemicals into the air. You will not find their names on the item labels. Traditional laundry detergents, fabric softeners, dryer sheets, and air fresheners in solid, spray, and oil kind might all give off such gasses.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in structures with poor IAQ might notice unpleasant or moldy odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are getting worse, speak to your doctor about them. However not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for good building management.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For instance, humans breathe out co2, which in small quantities is not hazardous, however may end up being hazardous if high concentrations are allowed to collect. Germs or micro-organisms may likewise exist within the ventilation system. They might spread throughout the entire work environment or building by ways of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do establish.<p>
