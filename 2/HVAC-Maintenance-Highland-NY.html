<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for assessment and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. The likelihood of instant reactions to indoor air pollutants depends on numerous elements consisting of age and preexisting medical conditions. In many cases, whether an individual reacts to a toxin depends on specific level of sensitivity, which differs greatly from individual to person.

Location control includes moving the pollutant source away from residents and even transferring vulnerable occupants.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>It might feel cozy being sealed in tight against the cold in your house throughout the chillier months of the year, however for individuals who are sensitive to indoor irritants or have breathing issues, winter can intensify problems.
