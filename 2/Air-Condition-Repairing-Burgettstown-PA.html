<p>Before cooling or installing any new heating system in a house, it is essential to re reduce the energy and evaluate load of the house. A more energy effective home will not only reduce the cost of a brand-new system and utility bills, but it will significantly improve the comfort of your home. Before we design and install any systems, we set up a house energy audit in which an energy auditor will advise enhancements and make estimates for cost and energy savings from these enhancements.

<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your house that ideal temperature level all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out a few of those common air pollutants. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their task. Not just does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it likewise wears down your AC system, which can lead to expensive repairs down the road. So, make certain to alter your AC filters regularly, or get an a/c service plan which usually consists of a filter change - particularly if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious aspect impacting indoor air quality, but it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more residents there are in a space or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from increasing too high-- which can have a negative effect on occupants-- outdoors air should be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
