<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the room temperature, and then change it ON. To prevent straining an ac system's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, search for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>

<p>Today's house radiant heat systems take full advantage of infrared radiation. Without a doubt, the most common source of a radiator in a house is the floor mass.

Other radiators are still utilized, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heaters-- although ceiling radiators are often utilized in commercial applications like storage facilities.<p>
