<p>Wetness management and humidity control needs operating HVAC systems as designed. Moisture management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to try to enhance the operation to conserve energy.

The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will eliminate the need to install a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
