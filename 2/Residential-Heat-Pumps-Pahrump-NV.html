<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
