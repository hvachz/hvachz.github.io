<p>Excellent Item! Delivery was type of weird being that the box was opened and products could have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The item was extremely lite weight and takes time to use. Note: buy suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to watch the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with assistance, we solved issues. I would recommend this item to anyone who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the first time.

<p>Just like many house improvement projects, the cost of a full central heating unit can differ extensively based on the size of the house. Most heaters will last between 15 and twenty years. In choosing a furnace, property owners need to think about heat output and effectiveness. Heat output is determined in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace ought to be matched to the size of the home. A small home, for example, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the home too quickly and shut down for too long, resulting in inconsistent temperature levels.<p>
