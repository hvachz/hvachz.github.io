<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a large central air conditioning conditioner system that sits outside your home. Heatpump work on electrical power and work like a/c in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This allows them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a basic electric heating system (like an area heater) with the same amount of electrical power. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>Airflow patterns in structure are determined by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural impacts. Atmospheric pressure differences developed by these forces move airborne toxins from locations of greater pressure to locations of lower pressure through any available opening in building walls, ceilings, floorings, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move up until the inside pressure amounts to the outside.<p>
<p>We have been exceptionally happy with Integrity's devices (Trane dealership) and service (today Braxten finished yearly maintenance of our system). Trane heatpump has worked very well and is so effective that it considerably reduced our utility expenses - the system will pay for itself in less than 5 years. The few times we have needed them for emergencies they reacted rapidly and resolved the issue.<p>
