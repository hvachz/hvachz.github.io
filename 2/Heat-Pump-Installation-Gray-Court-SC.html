<p>Buildings are designed or planned to respond actively to some of these changes in and around them with heating, cooling, aerating, air cleaning or illuminating systems.

In other cases, such changes discreetly and even significantly modify buildings in ways that may be essential to their own integrity or their effect on building occupants through the evolution of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that define them at any time. We may find it beneficial to integrate the tools of the physical sciences with those of the life sciences and, especially, some of the techniques utilized by scientists studying ecosystems, in order to gain an improved understanding of the environments in which we spend most of our time, our buildings.<p>
<p>The bureau projects 34 percent employment growth for HVAC specialists in between 2010 and 2020, more than two times the average for all professions.

For example, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon because the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and causing premature wear and tear, causing cracks and holes. , if that client had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and secures the component.. a very helpful result and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that potentially conserved a client thousands.<p>
