<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, conducted a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by enhancing air flow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, determined particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
