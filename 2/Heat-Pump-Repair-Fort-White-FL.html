<p>Airflow patterns in structure are identified by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural impacts. Air pressure distinctions produced by these forces move airborne toxins from locations of greater pressure to areas of lower pressure through any readily available opening in structure walls, ceilings, floors, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move until the inside pressure amounts to the exterior.<p>
<p>In more complex plans, warm air is allowed to increase and stream out high structure openings to the outdoors (stack result ), causing cool outdoors air to be drawn into low building openings. Natural ventilation plans can use very little energy, however care should be taken to guarantee comfort. In warm or humid environments, maintaining thermal comfort entirely by means of natural ventilation may not be possible. Cooling systems are used, either as backups or supplements. Air-side economizers also use outside air to condition areas, but do so utilizing fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to present and distribute cool outside air when proper.<p>
