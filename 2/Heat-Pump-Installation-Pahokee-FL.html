<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
