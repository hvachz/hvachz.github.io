<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
