<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outside unit as near to your home as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.)

<h3>HVAC Repair And You - What You Need to Know in Middle Village NY</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, carried out a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, determined particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
