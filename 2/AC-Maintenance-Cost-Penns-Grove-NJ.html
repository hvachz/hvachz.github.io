EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, offers further details on air-cleaning devices to minimize indoor air pollutants.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should temporarily change back into the regular cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
