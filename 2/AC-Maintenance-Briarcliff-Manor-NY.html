<p>There are some varieties of mold which contain poisonous substances (mycotoxins). Nevertheless, direct exposure to dangerous levels of mycotoxin by means of inhalation is not possible in most cases, as toxins are produced by the fungal body and are not at substantial levels in the launched spores. The main hazard of mold development, as it connects to indoor air quality, comes from the allergenic properties of the spore cell wall. More major than most allergenic properties is the ability of mold to trigger episodes in persons that currently have asthma, a severe breathing disease.<p>
<p>To be honest, few of the facilities managers who utilize our indoor air quality tracking service concerned us for that reason. Usually they were at first interested in from another location keeping an eye on some other aspect of their structures, such as energy use, in an effort to cut costs.

Experts suggest using filters with a MERV 6-8, but greater MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and generally are better for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>

<h3>HVAC Repair Warnings You Should Not Ignore Briarcliff Manor NY</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
