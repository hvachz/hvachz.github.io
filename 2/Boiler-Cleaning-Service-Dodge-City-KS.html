<p>Recent Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
