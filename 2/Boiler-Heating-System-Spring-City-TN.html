<p>If you think a mold problem-- either since of visible growth or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and check. Leaking return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you suspect a mold issue, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
