<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many heaters have numerous control boards. The largest, or just one in some furnaces, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and collaborate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the brand-new control board must be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work.
