<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heating units are still commonly utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>

<p>An undersize system won't have the ability to cool spaces down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate because it needs to run longer than a correctly sized unit. Because it just takes more electrical energy to run a bigger unit, an oversize compressor also costs more to operate. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has an opportunity to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the essential moisture. The result is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature indicates. In fact, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>
