<p>Terrific Item! Shipment was sort of weird being that the box was opened and products could have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we assured it was all intact. The product was incredibly lite weight and takes some time to apply. Keep in mind: purchase advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to see the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had issues with air bubble pockets.

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day.
