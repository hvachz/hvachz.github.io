<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as a Vital Organisation in Los Angeles. Today's furnaces are ranked 90% effectiveness or much better; it is not unusual for a contemporary furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older models, which might be ranked as low as 80% efficiency, this can mean considerable cost savings in annual heating costs. Modern 2- and three-stage heaters increase effectiveness even further by running at lower or higher capacity depending upon the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Dirty filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too rapidly, and your home won't heat up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
