<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't use them.  Secondly like extended automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the essential skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely benefited from. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally found somebody to properly service and the unit has been running issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network.

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your house.

From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
