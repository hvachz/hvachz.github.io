<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task finding the outdoor unit as close to your home as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Let's start by detailing the preparation that needs to occur before you in fact buy a furnace. Choosing a furnace for your home isn't as easy as selecting one off a showroom floor.

First, you'll require one that is correctly sized for your house. A furnace that is too big will put out too much heat for your system to deal with, and will cause problems like short-cycling that can reduce its life.

Wetness management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to conserve energy.

However, high humidity outdoors develops the requirement for mindful attention to humidity levels inside.

<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
