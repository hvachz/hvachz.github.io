<h3>Have Your HVAC System Serviced Annually in Leonardtown MD</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even small window plan systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or cleaned as conditions necessitate. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will require to have the filters changed more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Furthermore, really dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>Since an ac system moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both need to be kept tidy. This suggests that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also required to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately result in damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
