<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets requests for assessment and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies.

However, much of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
