<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in structures by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
