Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too.

While there aren't lots of repairs you can make yourself, there are specific maintenance procedures you can follow to keep your system running at peak effectiveness.<p>
