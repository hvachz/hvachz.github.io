These invisible electro-magnetic infrared waves radiate out from a warmed thermal mass. In a contained system like a home, the warmer things naturally heat the cooler ones till a balance is accomplished.<p>
<p>There's a huge distinction between the heat transfer of radiation and the other common form of home heating-- convection.
