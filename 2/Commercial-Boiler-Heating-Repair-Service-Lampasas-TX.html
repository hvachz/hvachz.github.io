<p>I am an investor, I need to change two heating systems in a 8000square foot home. Some sources, such as building products, furnishings and items like air fresheners, can launch toxins more or less constantly. Other sources, associated to activities like smoking, cleaning, refurnishing or doing hobblies release pollutants intermittently. Malfunctioning or unvented devices or poorly utilized items can launch greater and in some cases harmful levels of toxins indoors.<p>
<p>The very first air conditioners and fridges employed harmful or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that might result in deadly accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
