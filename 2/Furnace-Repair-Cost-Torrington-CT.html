Other's experiences with the company can answer these and many other questions.<p>

<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs silently and effectively, but to have 2 significant parts fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>For contaminants aside from radon, measurements are most suitable when there are either health signs or signs of poor ventilation and specific sources or toxins have actually been identified as possible causes of indoor air quality problems.

<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have concerns, they give me priority and a lower rate. Bought a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy prolonged warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
