<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct.

When the air conditioning system works but the house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
