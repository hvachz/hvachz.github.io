<p>A third method to decide whether your home may have bad indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air contamination.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid identify the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture, Air cleaning takes place. The objective is to offer adequate modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this. A common aspect required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
