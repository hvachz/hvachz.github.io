Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If numerous signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the decreased airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You have actually solved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
