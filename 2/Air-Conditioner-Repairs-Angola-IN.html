A more energy efficient house will not only minimize the cost of a brand-new system and energy expenses, however it will significantly improve the convenience of your home. Before we design and set up any systems, we arrange a home energy audit in which an energy auditor will suggest enhancements and make estimates for cost and energy cost savings from these improvements.

<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these three things initially. Make certain all the signs up in your house are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the problem.<p>

<p>The primary health effect associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might position risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
