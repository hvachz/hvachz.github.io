<p>In 2011, NASA was on the lookout for an a/c system to set up in their lunar electric rover. They decided they needed expert help and consulted many suppliers.

We have actually had a lot of firsts for many years, but this customized job presented special obstacles for our engineers," said a representative for Dometic.

<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the same. Once the circuitry is total, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television warms. Don't put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively harden and cure-- normally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>
<p>As pointed out above, activating your new under tile flooring heating system prematurely, before the mortar has actually treated, can cause the grout to break or to not adhere correctly, and may void the service warranty of your mortar product. In some testing, even the tile broken when the system was run before the substance had treated. And mortar manufacturers might decline guarantee protection if you do not follow their directions.<p>
