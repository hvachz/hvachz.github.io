<p>They were fantastic! Many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service initially asked for. They satisfied my needs completely by supplying an expert quote with options, without pressing extra items. The team appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and completed a little early. The likewise promptly followed up with the needed examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in buildings with poor IAQ might observe unpleasant or moldy odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are becoming worse, talk with your doctor about them. But not all exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no alternative to great building management.<p>
<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung around troubleshooting the problem, all the while discussing whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working effectively. He had to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will certainly use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
