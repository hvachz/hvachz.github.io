The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the a/c individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>

Nevertheless, it is not always real that the impacts kept in mind occur at the pollutant concentration levels usually found in the house.
