<p>Next, and possibly simply as crucial when it comes to central air costs, is the AC system's size.

Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
