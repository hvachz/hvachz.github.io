<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the check out. They suggested replacing a few parts that were going out.

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol impact, many typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from inadequately placed or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which often launch water in an aerosol which might enter neighboring ventilation consumption. Break outs in medical centers and retirement home, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually involved outside water fountains in public destinations. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to acquire infection.<p>
