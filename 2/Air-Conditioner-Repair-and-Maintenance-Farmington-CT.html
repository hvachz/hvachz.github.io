<p>At present, EPA does not suggest utilizing air cleaners to reduce levels of radon and its decay products. Due to the fact that they only partially remove the radon decay products and do not reduce the amount of radon entering the house, the efficiency of these gadgets is uncertain. EPA prepares to do extra research on whether air cleaners are, or could become, a trusted means of minimizing the health threat from radon. EPA's booklet, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, offers further details on air-cleaning gadgets to minimize indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on.

Before that happens, you want to get those capacitors altered to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
