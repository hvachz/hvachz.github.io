<h3>Three Crucial Spring Furnace Maintenance Tips in Greer SC</h3>

Because it just takes more electrical power to run a larger unit, a large-scale compressor also costs more to run. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has an opportunity to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the required wetness. The result is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature level suggests. In fact, the room can feel clammy and moist.<p>
