<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pressing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do decline them until they have actually been correctly dried. Attempt a different dry cleaner if products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
