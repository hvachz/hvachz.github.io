<p>The function of the majority of structure ventilation systems is to generate appropriate fresh air for resident comfort while controlling temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and constructing security at sensible energy costs. Your furnace has lots of parts that can impact the health and safety of you and your loved ones. Having a total check of your furnace will provide guarantee that it is safe to operate. Apotheosis Heating & Home Convenience Solutions Combustion Optimization & Safety Inspection of your furnace consists of a Health & Safety Analysis, which checks the heat exchanger (carbon monoxide gas leaks and contaminated breathing air), checks the pilot security (surge danger), checks the high limitation (fire danger) and includes a visual assessment for other threats.

<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00.
