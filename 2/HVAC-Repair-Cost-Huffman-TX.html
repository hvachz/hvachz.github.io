<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to start the compressor.

With time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Prior to that occurs, you want to get those capacitors altered to prevent further damage to your system.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine components. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs handled by specialists, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
