<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the price great but Mark headed out of his method to customize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
