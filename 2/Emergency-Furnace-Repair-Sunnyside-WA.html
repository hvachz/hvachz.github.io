Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Furthermore, extremely filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
