<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more difficult to manage than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity needs to be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to minimize mold growth.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless harmful gas. Because it is difficult to see, smell or taste, CO can eliminate you before you understand it is in your home. At lower levels of exposure, CO causes moderate effects that are typically incorrect for the flu. These symptoms include headaches, lightheadedness, fatigue, disorientation and nausea. The results of CO exposure can vary considerably from individual to individual depending upon age, general health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>
