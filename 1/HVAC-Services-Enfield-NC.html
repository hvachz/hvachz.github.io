<p>There is a transformer in your cooling furnace. The transformer is what materials 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer malfunctions, your Nest won't begin. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that protect your a/c system from flooding. One of the most typical places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a great possibility; you may have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have seen baseplate spoil on uncommon events.<p>
