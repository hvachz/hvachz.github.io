<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Second, recognition of contaminant sources is often important to figuring out the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such details can often be obtained by requesting copies of air tracking data from the employer. If monitoring data is not available, yet a high variety of health signs have been reported, the Union representative should ask for that the company have air monitoring tests conducted. Review of this data may determine possibly dangerous sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms.
