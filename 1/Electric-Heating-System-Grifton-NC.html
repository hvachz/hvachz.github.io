As discussed above, a BTU is a standard system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't use this measurement much anymore.<p>
