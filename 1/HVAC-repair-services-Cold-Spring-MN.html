<p>We added a new 1500 sf office space to perform our workshops and needed some heating. After calling Integrity we were provided a fantastic quote on a radiant flooring system.

<p>As a number of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is required by all significant equipment maker's to guarantee your factory warranties remain in place.

A lot of pieces of a furnace or ac system do not simply break at the snap of a finger, however rather is the outcome of repeated use of a part that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger might stop working too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and triggering early wear and tear, resulting in cracks and holes. , if that customer had received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the part.. an extremely advantageous result and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
