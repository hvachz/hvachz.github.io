<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
