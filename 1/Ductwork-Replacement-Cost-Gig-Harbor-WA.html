<h3>HVAC Furnace Air Filters - Things You Have to Know Before Buying in Gig Harbor WA</h3>
<p>There are many reasons this can happen. The bright side is that you can deal with a number of these aspects on your own without the need to require expert aid. Start by opening the heat signs up and then carry on to checking the thermostat settings. Next, inspect the furnace power, reset the furnace or check the service door cover. You can likewise examine the filter to make sure it is clear of dirt and examine the standing pilot light to make certain it is lit.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
