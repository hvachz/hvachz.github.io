<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
