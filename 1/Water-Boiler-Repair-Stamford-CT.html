<p>Keep an eye out for indications of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable products, flooring, ceiling, and wall coverings, and furniture discovered in the basements that have actually been damp for over 24 to 2 days may end up being a source for mold growth and must be discarded. Sometimes there is a moldy smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can prosper in concealed or seldom accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring materials consisting of carpet underpadding. Possibilities are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be found. Fix the wetness issue, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Completely clean the location utilizing established health department suggestions.<p>
