<p>Expert heating unit installations. For any contractor, HVAC or otherwise, these companies supply opportunities they can't accomplish on their own. The majority of owners stick with the bigger firms after acquisition. In some cases, the acquisition offers a method for the seller to retire and make certain employees are looked after.

<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your home will not warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A filthy filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
