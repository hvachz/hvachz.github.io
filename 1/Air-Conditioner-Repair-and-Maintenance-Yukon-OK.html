<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise changes functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>To establish a safe assessment or consultation with an HVAC technician during the COVID-19 pandemic, start by comparing professionals in your location in an online search.
