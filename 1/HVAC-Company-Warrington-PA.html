<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
