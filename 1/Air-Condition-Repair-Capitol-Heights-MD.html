<h3>The Basics of Central Heating and Air Conditioning at Capitol Heights MD</h3>
<p>There are lots of reasons why this can occur. The bright side is that you can address many of these factors on your own without the need to require expert help. Start by opening the heat signs up and then move on to checking the thermostat settings. Next, examine the furnace power, reset the furnace or check the service door cover. You can also check the filter to ensure it is clear of dirt and examine the standing pilot burner to make sure it is lit.<p>
<p>Inspect these three things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the registers in the house are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). If numerous signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the minimized air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
