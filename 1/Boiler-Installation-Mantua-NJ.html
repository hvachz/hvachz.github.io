<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol impact, a lot of commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from improperly placed or kept evaporative cooling towers, which typically release water in an aerosol which may enter close-by ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and assisted living home, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually included outdoor water fountains in public attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is extremely under-reported, as healthy people require heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>
