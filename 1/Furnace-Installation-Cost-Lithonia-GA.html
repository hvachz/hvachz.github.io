<p>The quality of the air inside our homes, schools and offices matters, especially given that we invest the majority of our lives indoors. Air conditioners help to dehumidify the incoming air, however in very humid environments or in cases where the ac system is oversized, it might not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the a/c unit will require more energy to cool your home. A more effective alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outdoor system as near to the house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Outdoor Air Conditioner in Lithonia GA 30058</h3>
<p>I usually do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my choices. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over choices. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>
<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was really practical in gathering info on the phone and providing clear directions about how to momentarily manage the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and used clear interaction about the problem, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and house.<p>
