<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outdoor system as near to your home as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>We take a look at hints before we provide suggestions to replace instead of repair a heating system. One of the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to usage, or if energy expenses are greater every year, we know the system is not running effectively. It may be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more effective model, then you would be wasting cash by not replacing the older system.<p>
