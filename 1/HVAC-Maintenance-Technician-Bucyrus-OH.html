<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Properly maintained heating devices can last for many years. But if you're experiencing frequent breakdowns or your fuel bills suddenly seem greater than regular, it is probably time to consider a new system. New heating devices is even more efficient-- you'll see lower fuel expenses right away, not to discuss the cash you'll minimize repair costs. You can probably expect to cut your fuel bills in half if your heating system is 25 years old or more.<p>
<p>More common in reasonably older homes, a boiler-based heating system utilizes gas, electricity or oil to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in private rooms. All-electric boilers can attain up to 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. More recent gas boilers should achieve 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers should achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transferring the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating unit.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to secure your financial investment by just using the services of a licensed contractor or a certified representative from a company or merchant to do the installation. If you choose to attempt to do it yourself, or work with a non-licensed person to do the work, in many, if not all cases, you will void the warranty for the a/c system. A voided guarantee will not do you any great must the system fail or malfunction. Do it right from the beginning and hire a certified person with the experience to set up the system.<p>
