<h3>How Central Heating Boilers Keep Your Vanceboro NC Home Toasty Warm</h3>
<p>Ductless air conditioning is, of course, ideal for houses without ducts, but is also a flexible service for a variety of other circumstances. Instead of pressing cool air through shafts in walls, attic and floor, ductless systems circulate air directly to specific spaces. Extremely cost-effective, and energy-efficient, and offering greater control over when and where the air enters your house, All Points Heating can assist you select the best ductless a/c system for your needs.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
