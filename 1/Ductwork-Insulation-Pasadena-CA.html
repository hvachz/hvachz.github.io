<p>There is a transformer in your cooling furnace. The transformer is what materials 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest won't come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire.

Among the most typical places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a good chance; you may have a water leakage in the attic.
