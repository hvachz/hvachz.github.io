<p>Radiant heat covers a range of various heating systems, including electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats up by distributing warm water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the room.<p>

<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical material gradually. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
