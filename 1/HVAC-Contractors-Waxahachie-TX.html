A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, consisting of installation. Whole-house systems, on the other hand, range in price from $2,500 to $7,500, consisting of installation.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The goal is to offer adequate modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this. A common element necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
