<p>Usually, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. If your AC unit is wintry, the evaporator coil is probably frozen. Likewise, if the a/c unit smells bad, there might be germs buildup on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil takes in the heat away from your home. It will take from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to change the a/c's evaporator coil.<p>

<p>A geothermal heating system is more trustworthy than alternatives, and is not affected by any external factors, unlike other renewable energies such as wind energy and solar power. For example, wind energy can only be used when there is wind, while solar energy depends on routine sunshine to work effectively. Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the sun nor the wind, but rather takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot. This makes geothermal heating a reputable and readily available source of energy.<p>
