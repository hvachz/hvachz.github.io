<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise switches roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>You ought to always work with a professional to carry out AC repair, for the very same reason that you rely on a professional plumber or electrical expert.
