<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in monthly, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to offer auto debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract..
