<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall.

Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the property.<p>
