Taylor assisted us narrow the scope to a sensible level, a heatpump replacement for our oil furnace, while allowing me to carry out the essential electrical improvements to save money on cost.<p>

Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to effectively service and the system has actually been operating problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
