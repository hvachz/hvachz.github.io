<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
