They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy.

The outside condenser unit also changes roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your floor tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
