<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>There are two main types of radiant floor heating, or RFH as it's known in the home heating company. One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the flooring surface. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the floor are required to withstand current, which then generates heat.<p>
<p>This is especially notable, as gas ranges can trigger levels of contamination that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with inadequately adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Numerous AC systems include a number of special features that can even more enhance efficiency and efficiency. For example, house owners may wish to look for one that comes with a built-in filter light that will alert you when the air filter needs to be changed.
