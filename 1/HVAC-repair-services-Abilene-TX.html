<p>Truth: Federal and local rewards generally total up to between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can frequently make the initial rate of a system competitive with traditional devices.

Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per heap, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per heap.
