<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one constraint: their total power must not exceed the capacity of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units greater than the outside capability by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to anticipate much better efficiency when all indoor systems are turned on at the very same time, considering that the total capacity of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outside unit. Put simply, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all running indoor systems in such a method that a few of the spaces might not have a really comfortable temperature level. However, the calculation of the overall power is not easy, considering that it takes into consideration not just the small power of the units, however also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
<p>A SEER rating stands for Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER ranking of a system is the cooling output at varying temperatures during the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input during the exact same duration. Basically, SEER supplies more data based upon how the EER carries out in various temps. The higher the unit's SEER score, the more energy effective it is. 1 A system's SEER score can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all home appliances.<p>
