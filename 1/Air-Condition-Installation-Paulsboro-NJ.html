<p>A 3rd way to decide whether your house might have bad indoor air quality is to take a look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, look for indications of problems with the ventilation in your home. Signs that can suggest your home may not have sufficient ventilation include moisture condensation on windows or walls, stuffy or smelly air, filthy central heating and air cooling devices, and areas where books, shoes, or other products end up being musty. To identify odors in your home, step outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering your house, note whether smells are visible.<p>
<p>Consider possible effects of indoor air pollution if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heating system. Follow the producer's instructions, specifically guidelines on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heating system correctly changed. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is generally an indicator of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While a space heater remains in usage, open a door from the room where the heating system lies to the remainder of the house and open a window somewhat.<p>
