<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the same. As soon as the circuitry is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Don't put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to properly solidify and treat-- normally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom floor.<p>
