<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is burning out cold, you may not have an issue as long as your house still heats to the right temperature level.

However, if your system does not seem working properly, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you must hire a specialist to check and repair the system.<p>
