<h3>The Way to Pick An HVAC Company in Scottsville KY</h3>
<p>Sean was extremely practical. He is a very pleasant individual to work with. No pressure applied to purchase extra things. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no concerns other than the blower motor. The only factor he could not install the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood just what the issue was and repaired it extremely quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
