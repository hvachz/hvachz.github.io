<p>Even if you don't feel unclean, pollen hold on to your hair and clothes where it can easily aggravate your nose and eyes, and add to indoor air pollution. Don't have time for a quick rinse? At least clean your hands to remove remaining pollen, especially prior to making contact with food or your face, recommends the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. Attempt these techniques to pollen-proof your life, specifically during allergy season.<p>
<p>Some health effects might appear soon after a single exposure or repeated direct exposures to a contaminant. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such immediate impacts are treatable and usually short-term.
