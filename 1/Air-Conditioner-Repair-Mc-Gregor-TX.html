<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act much like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most budget friendly. Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the requirement to set up a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
