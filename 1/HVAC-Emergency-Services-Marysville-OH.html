<h3>Installation of HVAC in Marysville Ohio</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the property.<p>
<p>2. Keep a healthy level of humidity. Allergen and mold love moisture. Keeping humidity around 30% -50% helps keep them and other irritants under control.

An air conditioner likewise reduces indoor pollen count - another plus for allergy -patients.<p>
