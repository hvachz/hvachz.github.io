<p>Individuals working in structures with poor IAQ might discover undesirable or moldy odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems.
