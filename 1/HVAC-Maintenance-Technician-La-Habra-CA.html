<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping in between a outside and indoor unit rather of ducting air directly from the outside system. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
