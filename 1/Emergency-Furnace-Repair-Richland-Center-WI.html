<p>As a lot of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment producer's to guarantee your factory service warranties stay in place. Furthermore, the concrete results of a PM is typically tough to measure, as one action mentioned the cost savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. The majority of pieces of a furnace or a/c unit do not simply break at the breeze of a finger, but rather is the result of repetitive use of a component that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely since the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and triggering premature wear and tear, leading to cracks and holes. , if that client had received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the component.. an extremely advantageous result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a client thousands.<p>
