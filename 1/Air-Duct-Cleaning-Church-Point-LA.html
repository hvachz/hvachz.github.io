<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn In Your Air Conditioner at Church Point LA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was very clear and fast about his evaluation, guaranteeing I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>Examine these three things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the registers in your home are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The reduced airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
