<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Service in Landenberg</h2>

<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives requests for consultation and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, a number of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
