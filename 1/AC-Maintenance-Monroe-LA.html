The selection of indoor systems has one limitation: their total power must not exceed the capacity of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor systems higher than the outdoor capacity by a minimum of 20%.

Basically, the outdoor system will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that some of the spaces might not have an extremely comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the computation of the total power is not easy, because it takes into account not just the nominal power of the systems, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
