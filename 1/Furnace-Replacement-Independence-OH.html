<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

<p>They were great! Many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally asked for. They met my needs completely by supplying an expert quote with options, without pressing additional items. The crew appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also without delay followed up with the needed evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly advise this company.<p>
<p>If the AC does not shut off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not produce heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have bonded together-- something that can take place with time since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to suffice until you purchase a replacement-- which you ought to do quickly.<p>

The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, prior to the air is flowed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
