<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Regulation banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>

<p>AC units and thermostats have built-in hold-up features when they're closed down and then repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually signed up for an energy-saving device from your local power energy, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts revealed and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature level below the indoor temperature level, and the unit does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>When the heatpump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was extremely useful in collecting information on the phone and providing clear directions about how to momentarily cope with the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and provided clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will certainly use Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>
