<p>Another method to reducing the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your home is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming indoors. The majority of home heating and cooling systems, consisting of required air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window a/c with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate.

If you buy a brand-new gas range or range, consider buying one with pilotless ignition since it does not have a pilot burner that burns continually. Never ever use a gas range to heat your house. When the fireplace is in usage, constantly make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>
