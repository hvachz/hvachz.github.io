<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an enough temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, supplying warm air to specific bedrooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
