<p>Typically, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. If your AC unit is frosty, the evaporator coil is probably frozen. Also, if the air conditioning system smells bad, there could be bacteria accumulation on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil takes in the heat far from your house.

Toxins might originate from outside the home-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in an attached garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon entering the house from the ground listed below. An air pollutant could also originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a malfunctioning furnace, unpredictable natural compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or damp carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, family cleaning, or individual care products. Infections and germs, family pet dander, and bug parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
