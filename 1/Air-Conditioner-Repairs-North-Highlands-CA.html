<p>There are numerous reasons that this can take place. Fortunately is that you can address a number of these aspects on your own without the requirement to require expert help.

<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might require a recommendation in the future). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Get rid of the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>

And, if you have actually registered for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts shown and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature below the indoor temperature, and the unit doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can take place with time due to the fact that of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should suffice till you buy a replacement-- which you must do soon.<p>
