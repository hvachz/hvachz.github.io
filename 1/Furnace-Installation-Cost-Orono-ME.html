<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
