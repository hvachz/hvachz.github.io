<p>Due to the fact that an a/c unit moves heat between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil, both must be kept clean. This indicates that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately result in harm to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is taken in from inside and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of pollutant sources is frequently important to figuring out the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such information can in some cases be gotten by asking for copies of air tracking data from the employer. If keeping an eye on data is not available, yet a high number of health symptoms have been reported, the Union agent ought to ask for that the employer have air monitoring tests carried out. Review of this information might recognize possibly hazardous sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. Nevertheless, when contaminant concentrations are extremely low, keeping an eye on data may not discuss the observed or reported health signs.<p>
