Without it, you have no cooling. Depending on its positioning on your home and its maintenance, it may sustain some damage throughout the winter. Most of the time, this simply includes some accumulation of dirt and debris, which is pretty simple to remove. Your Sacramento HVAC technician will wipe the outside of the unit and make sure that there is no rust, damage from collected moisture, or excessive wear to the exterior. They may suggest that you trim back overgrown trees or bushes to guarantee appropriate airflow around the system.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your home won't warm up. Change the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
