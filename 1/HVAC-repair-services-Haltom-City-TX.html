No matter what the type of home HVAC system, sufficient air circulation (ventilation), correct filtration, and humidity manage all contribute to a healthy indoor air environment. > Also, regular maintenance of the HVAC system will make sure that it is running safely and not adding to or causing an indoor air problem.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a pipe two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut down the electricity open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
