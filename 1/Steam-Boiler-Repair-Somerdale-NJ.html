<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act just like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most economical. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to install a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you must examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
