<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical product over time.

Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
