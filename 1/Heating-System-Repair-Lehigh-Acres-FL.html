<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should momentarily change back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
