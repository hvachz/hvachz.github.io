<p>We contacted Elite HEATING AND COOLING on one of the most popular days of summertime( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out exact same day to examine situation & chose to opt for them for the work. I more than happy to say that not just did we get the central air conditioning going but also replaced the heating system which was old. Everyone we talked to from starting to end were extremely expert, polite and the work was extremely efficiently done. I would extremely recommend this company.<p>
<p>Iâ $ m actually picky with my stuff. I like my equipment and devices initial, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with cheap knock-offs. So buying this a/c unit to replace my old one was rather of a tough fact. You canâ $ t trust the commercial these days. Am delighted I got this though since it has actually restored my faith in great production. I havenâ $ t had a problem with this new Carrier I got given that I bought it 7 months ago. Itâ $ s simply perfect.<p>
