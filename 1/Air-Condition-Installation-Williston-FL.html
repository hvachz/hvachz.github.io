<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is likewise evidence from animal studies that repeated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. People at specific threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and individuals with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>

<p>Biological pollutants include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and individuals; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these contaminants through the house.<p>
