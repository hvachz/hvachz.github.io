<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and pollutant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that permits the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system elements, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in big residential, office, and school structures.<p>

<p>A geothermal heating system does not generate its power by burning nonrenewable fuel sources such as gas, coal, or oil. Rather, it soaks up heat from within the earth.

<p>I had a terrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Furthermore, the company utilized 98% of the existing material acquired with the house. This company presented a service agreement contract to provide service to heating, electrical and plumbing. Throughout the evaluation on a very cold day they eliminated the furnace claiming health hazard factor and contractor laws for their choice. As a brand-new homeowner I have discovered how to determine the truthful HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
