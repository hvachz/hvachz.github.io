<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task locating the outdoor system as near to your home as possible per my request. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.)
