<p>How environment modification affects air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for contemporary air conditioners) needs that the rate of energy removal by the ac system increase. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit should increase its power intake by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are becoming common features of environment-friendly homes as part of the growing green structure movement.

That's approaching 30 to 40 percent of the entire housing market.<p>
