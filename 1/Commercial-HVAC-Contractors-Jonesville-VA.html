<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise because 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one restriction: their total power must not go beyond the capability of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units greater than the outside capacity by a minimum of 20%. However, it is wrong to expect better efficiency when all indoor units are turned on at the very same time, given that the overall capability of the entire system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor unit. Basically, the outside unit will disperse all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that some of the spaces may not have a really comfortable temperature level. However, the calculation of the overall power is not basic, given that it considers not just the small power of the units, but likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
<p>There are many things to take into consideration when attempting to determine how typically I should replace my a/c filters.
