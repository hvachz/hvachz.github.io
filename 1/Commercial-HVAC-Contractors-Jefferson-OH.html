<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
