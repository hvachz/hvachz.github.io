The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most budget-friendly. Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to set up an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
