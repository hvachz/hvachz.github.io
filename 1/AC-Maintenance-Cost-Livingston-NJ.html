Mold does not need light to grow and can thrive in surprise or hardly ever accessed locations of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials including carpet underpadding.
