Your heating and cooling contractor needs to assess and, if needed, upgrade the structure envelope. For instance, he may seal spaces and fractures in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling expenses. Insulation may be a more effective option to your cooling issues than changing your equipment.<p>

When ventilation is not adequate to account for a boost in the number of workers in the area, stagnant air might also be a problem.<p>

Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are tidy, clean them once again. Shut off the power. Flip the a/c service and furnace breaker in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the disconnect block (Photo 1) and clean the condenser coils (Picture 2). If the cooling service still doesn't work effectively after you've cleaned up the condenser coils, set up a new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs. Your AC won't work completely unless you do this.<p>

From the most fundamental, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter often in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all need some standard maintenance. These filters aid with indoor air quality by trapping airborne contaminants flowing through your system. They can also keep your system performing well by helping in reducing the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from building up on internal elements like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
