<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for dwelling residents. Unlike other kinds of ac system, evaporative coolers count on the outdoors air to be funnelled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a house through its duct system; this cooled outside air should be allowed to press the warmer air within your home out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically easy to maintain and understand.<p>
