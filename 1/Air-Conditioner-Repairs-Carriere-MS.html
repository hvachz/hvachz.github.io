<p>As much of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all significant devices manufacturer's to ensure your factory service warranties remain in location. Moreover, the tangible outcomes of a PM is frequently hard to measure, as one action stated the savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. Most pieces of a furnace or air conditioner do not just break at the snap of a finger, but rather is the result of repetitive use of a part that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger might stop working too soon because the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and causing early degeneration, leading to cracks and holes. , if that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and secures the component.. a very useful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
