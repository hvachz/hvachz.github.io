The majority of pieces of a furnace or a/c do not simply break at the snap of a finger, but instead is the result of repeated usage of an element that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger may fail prematurely since the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature degeneration, leading to cracks and holes. , if that client had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the element.. a very beneficial outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
