<p>I am really pleased with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company many years ago and know the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise pleased that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year.

<p>A packaged unit, usually set up on the roofing system, is most commonly used on commercial structures, however it is also a choice for homeowners to consider. Many times, these units contain not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those wanting to save money on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system separately, because the unit is combined. However, one con is that these systems are generally only offered for bigger homes due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be an excellent way to save cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more costly than purchasing just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best alternative for homeowners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
