<p>All Points Heating uses home cooling, a/c unit installation, air conditioning unit maintenance that provide reliable, tested performance at high effectiveness. Combustion items from auto exhaust, heating systems, hot water heater, space heaters, aromatic candle lights, oil lamps, wood stoves, fireplaces, and gas stoves that are not effectively vented can generate carbon monoxide gas, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates.
