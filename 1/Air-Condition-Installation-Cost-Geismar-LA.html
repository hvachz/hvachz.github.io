<p>All homes need effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has been burnt out from use. Another possible factor could be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the proper temperature. Heaters that kick on often might be because of a dirty filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal concern. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even a filthy burner.<p>

Radon gas enters houses through dirt floorings, cracks in concrete walls and floors, floor drains, and sumps. Direct exposure to radon becomes an issue when radon becomes caught in concentrations and structures construct up indoors.<p>
