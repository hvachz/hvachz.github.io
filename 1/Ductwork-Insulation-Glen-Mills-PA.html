<p>All houses need effective ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has been stressed out from usage. Another possible reason might be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the right temperature level. Heaters that kick on often may be because of a filthy filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air effectively.
