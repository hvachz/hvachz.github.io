<p>All homes require effective ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others.

If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal concern. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled and even an unclean burner.<p>
