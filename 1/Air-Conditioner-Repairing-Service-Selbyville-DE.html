Others were nearly two times the quantity Protex priced quote for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex effectively advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The install team was considerate of my house and installed the equipment in the expected quantity of time. post install evaluation outcomes look excellent for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 years of age 4 lot R22 unit it replaced (also Provider).<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a tube two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your home. Now the "tough part" once a year shut down the electricity open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the parts, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
