<p>Appropriate ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. Goettl is a growing HVAC contractor with an older name. The firm started in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature clients for years, until the mandate for high-efficiency units forced Goettl to end production. The contracting side of the business continued under a number of owners. Goodrich's daddy was a Goettl dealer in Las Vegas, so when the chance came to purchase what was left of the company in 2013, he took it.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of typical a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or so. Unscrew the old AC contactor before getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Photo 6).<p>

<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
