<p>The results of lead exposure on fetuses and kids can be extreme. They consist of hold-ups in physical and mental development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Children, infants, and fetuses are more vulnerable to lead exposure than grownups because lead is more quickly absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more sensitive to the harmful results of lead.

<p>As with homes, the most essential factor affecting indoor air quality is the existence of contaminant sources. Commonly discovered office contaminants and their sources. consist of environmental tobacco smoke; asbestos from insulating and fire-retardant structure materials; formaldehyde from pushed wood items; other organics from constructing materials, carpet, and other workplace home furnishings, cleaning activities and products, toilet air fresheners, paints, adhesives, photocopier, and photography and print shops; biological impurities from dirty ventilation systems or water-damaged walls, ceilings, and carpets; and pesticides from pest management practices.<p>
<p>Most central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c works however the house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
