Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the traditional hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the traditional water heater.
