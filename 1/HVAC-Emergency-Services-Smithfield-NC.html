<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in monthly, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to provide vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
