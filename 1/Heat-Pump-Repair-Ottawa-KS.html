<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash being available in monthly, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to use car debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
