We had acquired the club member maintenance plan, which assisted balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any homebuyers: work with Blue Flame to check the air conditioner prior to you purchase. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam stated he had ways to check AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>

For systems requiring just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and carrying out far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "low-cost" by many people.<p>
