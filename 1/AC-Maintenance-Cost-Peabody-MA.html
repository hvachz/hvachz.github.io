<p>Immediate discount rates on high-efficiency heat pump technologies are readily available to devices installers, used at the wholesaler or supplier point-of-purchase. Excellent Customer Service! Environment Pro is reliable and really cared about us and our situation. We got home one evening to a cold house. I called Environment Pro, and Warren came by that exact same night. Although he didn't have actually the needed replacement part in his van, he changed his schedule so he might try to find and acquire it the next morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was definitely grateful to have a heated home again. What's most remarkable was that this all happened during Thanksgiving week!

<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. Due to the fact that approximately 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leakages in your ducts, a ductless system has an integrated efficiency advantage. Due to the fact that they do not require any brand-new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are great for additions. Due to the fact that a system is installed in each space or area you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature level in the space when you are present.<p>
