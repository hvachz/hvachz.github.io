<h3>HVAC Installation in Brooklyn Maryland</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the home.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not use automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in each month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to use car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.. There must not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
