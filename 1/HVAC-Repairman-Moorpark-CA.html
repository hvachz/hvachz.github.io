<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts.

<p>I usually don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my options. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss options. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
