<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He knew just what the problem was and repaired it very rapidly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
