Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right now, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the unit sits. I feel like they provide me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a bit more for that comfort.<p>
