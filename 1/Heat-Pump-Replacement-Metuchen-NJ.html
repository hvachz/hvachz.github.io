<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, managing the power to the heating wires and likewise regulating the temperature of the floor. All circuitry for your radiant heating system either goes to it or from it. Most people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the room they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the area is dry and unblocked.<p>
<p>We suggest using our insulation boards when setting up over concrete slabs. When utilized in combination with underfloor heating by acting as a very efficient thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money. They reflects the heat upwards into the flooring tile rather of enabling heat to warm up the concrete piece below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after turning on your heating, your flooring tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service many years earlier and know the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
