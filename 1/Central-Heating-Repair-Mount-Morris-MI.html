With an average cost that ranges from $2,500 to $14,000 to install, they are not the least costly alternative, but newer systems can be really energy efficient.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should briefly switch back into the routine a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
