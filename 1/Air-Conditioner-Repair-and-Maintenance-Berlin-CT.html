<p>Indoor air contamination originates from a variety of sources; the US Epa (EPA) has identified structure products, furnishings, and mold as major concerns, but much of the danger also originates from burning things. For example, smoking cigarettes or burning wood for heating or cooking can create contamination in homes that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is a particularly big problem in the developing world.<p>
<p>People working in structures with poor IAQ might discover unpleasant or musty smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not going away or are worsening, speak to your medical professional about them. However not all exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no substitute for good structure management.<p>
