<p>How environment change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for modern air conditioning unit) requires that the rate of energy removal by the ac system increase. This boost has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the ac system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the approach is referred to as radiant heating.<p>
