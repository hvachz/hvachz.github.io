<h3>Which Are Inverted Heat Pumps in Mount Carmel PA?</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, performed a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, measured particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
