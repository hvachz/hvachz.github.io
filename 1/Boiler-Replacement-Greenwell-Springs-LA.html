<p>The predominant health impact connected with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
