<h3>Selecting Commercial HVAC Repair Services in Plainfield IN</h3>
<p>When building your brand-new house a well-functioning Heating and Cooling system is vital, in addition to the air quality you breathe within. We have the experience and resources required to help from the planning phases through to the final installation. We utilize the latest software to assist design your ductwork system and use the highest quality products in the construction and installation.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
