<p>Indoor impurities. These include chemicals used in the building and construction or restoration of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Insufficient combustion and bad ventilation of these home appliances (cook ranges, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can contribute to indoor pollutants. Gas cook tops should be utilized with fans that send out exhaust outside.

Wood-burning stoves can also develop particulates and need to be vented outside.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your home that best temperature level all year round.
