<p>My eldest child constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him however then I recognized that it truly didnâ $ t distribute air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really consider anything else other than changing it. The one I got is worth every cent.
