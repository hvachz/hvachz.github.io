<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for modern-day air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning unit increase. This increase has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner removes that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
