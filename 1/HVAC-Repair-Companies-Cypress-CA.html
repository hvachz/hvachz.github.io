<h3>Electric Heating in Cypress CA 90630</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat.
