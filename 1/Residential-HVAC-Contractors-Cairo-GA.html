HVAC experts suggest following this standard rule when choosing whether it's worth investing in a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost over half the rate of a brand-new system, it's best to purchase brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have much more years left in it, and it's likely to be utilizing more energy than needed.<p>
