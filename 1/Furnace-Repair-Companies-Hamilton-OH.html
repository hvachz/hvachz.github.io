<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more difficult to manage than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity ought to be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The objective is to supply sufficient modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A common aspect necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
