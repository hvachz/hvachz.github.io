<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity specialist at a large merchant who asked not to be called since he did not have approval to speak on the record, it is common for large retail operations to have a team that routinely monitors energy consumption and temperatures in stores to save on expenses (particularly in the evening) and to alert store supervisors if temperature levels in the shops fluctuate beyond an appropriate variety that might avoid consumers from shopping at the store.<p>
<p>Numerous AC systems come with a number of unique features that can even more enhance performance and efficiency. For example, homeowners may want to search for one that includes a built-in filter light that will inform you when the air filter requires to be altered. Another popular feature to try to find is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on at night to reduce energy expenses a lot more. Naturally, more features imply higher central air costs.<p>
