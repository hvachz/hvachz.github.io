The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor pollutants and assists exhaust them from the house.<p>

A voided guarantee won't do you any great should the system stop working or breakdown. Do it right from the start and hire a licensed person with the experience to install the system.<p>
