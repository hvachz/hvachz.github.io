<h3>Frequent Reasons For Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Nevada MO</h3>
<p>The icing problem becomes a lot more serious with lower outside temperature levels, so heatpump are frequently set up in tandem with a more traditional kind of heating, such as an electrical heater, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized instead of the heatpump during harsher winter temperatures. In this case, the heatpump is used effectively during the milder temperatures, and the system is changed to the traditional heat source when the outside temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
