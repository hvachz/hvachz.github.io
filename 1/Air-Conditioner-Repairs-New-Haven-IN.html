For instance, you may attempt participating in home and garden programs, exhibition or other sort of event marketing. Or maybe you'll introduce a contest, a free gift or an unique financing plan to increase equipment sales. If the experiments settle, you can formalize them as part of the marketing strategy you outline in next year's business plan.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on.
