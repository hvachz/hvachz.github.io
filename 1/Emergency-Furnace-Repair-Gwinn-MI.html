In this case, the heat pump is used effectively during the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the standard heat source when the outdoor temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the consistent heat circulation over the entire surface of a floor heats up the lower half of the space, enveloping residents in warmth at a lower overall temperature-- in many cases up to 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a conventional heating unit."
