Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the home.<p>

Their techs are expert and really educated. Costs are affordable. Constantly on time, and call when they are on their method. Waychoff set up a new air handler and condenser this week. I did not bother to get rival's quotes due to the fact that of my trust in Waychoff because the cost was obviously reasonable.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
