<p>When installing a wall sensor, consider the height at which they need to be positioned. Many frequently they are installed at height-level or slightly lower, if people primarily remain seated in that specific location. However, the molecular weight of some compounds makes them gravitate towards the floor or ceiling; depending upon what contaminant you're attempting to track you'll need to place the sensing unit accordingly. For instance, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air therefore the greatest concentrations inside buildings are typically near the ceiling. Conversely, ozone is much heavier than air and stays near the flooring.<p>
