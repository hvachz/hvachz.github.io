<p>Volatile natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals discharged as gases from processes or products; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs inside include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.

Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could consist of unstable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within throughout water use.<p>
<p>Depending upon where in the US your home is located, the local area's environment can change considerably.
