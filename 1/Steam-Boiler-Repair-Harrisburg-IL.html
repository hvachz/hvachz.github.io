<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for modern-day air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy removal by the a/c increase. This boost has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the a/c has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c unit's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
