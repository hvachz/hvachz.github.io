<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO maintain the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, select your contractor carefully, much of the 'reputable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales tactics that DO take advantage of uninformed property owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a reputable company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>When it comes to heated water or steam, piping is used to transport the heat to the rooms. Most modern-day warm water boiler heating systems have a circulator, which is a pump, to move warm water through the distribution system (as opposed to older gravity-fed systems ). The heat can be transferred to the surrounding air utilizing radiators, warm water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators may be mounted on walls or installed within the flooring to produce floor heat.<p>
