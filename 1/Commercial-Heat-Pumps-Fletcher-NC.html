<h2>How To Hire Emergency HVAC Company in Fletcher</h2>

<p>Today, millions of allergen, dead skin cells, construction particles, and mold might be living in your house's duct, impacting the air you breathe along with the performance of your heating and a/c system. Indoor air quality isn't on most people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a danger to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a current study by the Customer Reports National Research Center. However many of the things individuals do-- or don't do-- can add to the stew of airborne contaminants in their homes and worsen asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and impurity concentrations in multizone building systems.

CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, office, and school structures.<p>
