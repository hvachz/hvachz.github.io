<p>Next, and perhaps simply as essential when it comes to central air conditioning costs, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too big will have an easy time keeping the house cool, but will have a harder time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not have the ability to appropriately cool the home on hot days. Considering bigger units cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC system your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
