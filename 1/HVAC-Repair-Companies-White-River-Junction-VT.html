<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Items HVAC Repairin White River Junction VT</h3>
<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of replacing or exchanging air in any area to supply high indoor air quality which includes temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and elimination of moisture, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne germs, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation eliminates undesirable smells and extreme wetness, introduces outdoors air, keeps interior structure air circulating, and avoids stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
