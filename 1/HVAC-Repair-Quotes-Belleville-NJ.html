The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>

The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
