<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system".

When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise switches roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
