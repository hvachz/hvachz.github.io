<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The very same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
<p>More typical in relatively older houses, a boiler-based heating system uses gas, electricity or oil to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in individual rooms. All-electric boilers can accomplish approximately 95 to one hundred percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers need to attain 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers should accomplish a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
