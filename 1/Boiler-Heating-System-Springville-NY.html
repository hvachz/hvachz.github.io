<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also switches functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
