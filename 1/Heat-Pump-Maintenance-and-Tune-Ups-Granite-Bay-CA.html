Taylor took ample time to assist us dispute which upgrades were cost efficient, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest savings.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

<p>The split system is the most typical. Many people are utilized to seeing this key in the yards of homes. With split system units, most of the components are housed in a metal box beyond the house. Nevertheless, there are some internal elements too. Split systems are ideal for cooling numerous rooms at once, but are not extremely energy efficient. For that reason, one pro is not having loud devices in the home. At the exact same time, the con would be that those who use this may spend more money on cooling expenses in the long run because of the lower energy performance.<p>
