The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c works however your house doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>

<p>My oldest child constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I understood that it actually didnâ $ t disperse air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think of anything else except replacing it. The one I got deserves every cent. The noise level is low and itâ $ s fantastic on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an essential role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of processes which leads to the supply and removal of air from inside a building." Those processes consist of generating outdoors air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the structure, and moving some part of indoor air exterior. The quality of indoor air will be affected if one or more of these processes are underperforming.<p>
