<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The very same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your house. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned routinely, they can become blocked with particles that can limit airflow, possibly affecting your comfort and your system's efficiency. Filthy filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace elements and in more extreme cases cause the system to close down completely. By comparison, checking and replacing a furnace filter can generally be carried out in simply a few minutes, frequently with no tools required. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
