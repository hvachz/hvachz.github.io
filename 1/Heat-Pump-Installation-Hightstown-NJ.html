<p>The purpose of many structure ventilation systems is to bring in appropriate fresh air for resident convenience while controlling temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and building security at affordable energy costs. Load calculating is referred to as the Handbook J computation and ought to be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to offering an installation or unit cost for cooling. If your contractor states they understand the size of air conditioning system you need based upon experience or on square footage alone, move to another contractor. Just like measuring the size of a system needed based upon BTUs, figuring out the correct size of unit for your home also depends on the unit load-- how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps can be easily integrated with existing systems such as conventional forced air or radiant flooring heating or can be installed in a new building.

Usually, a 3-ton setup needs to suffice for the average house, but house size, heating and cooling needs, local geology and soil, and land availability are all elements which will affect the right size for your specific home. Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heat pump installation and can help you effectively size a system.<p>
