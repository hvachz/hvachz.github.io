<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning system back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packaging material to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, location two 2x4s underneath the box to raise it up and protect it from moisture.<p>

Second of all, if you prepare to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, specifically concrete in basements, make certain that an effective moisture barrier is set up prior to installing the carpet. If it ends up being damp, do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be gotten rid of.<p>
