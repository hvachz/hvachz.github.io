<p>Excellent Product! Delivery was type of unusual being that package was opened and products could have fell out. But after review of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The product was extremely lite weight and takes time to apply. Note: buy recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to enjoy the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.

<p>The guidelines that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the very same. When the wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly treat and solidify-- typically 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom flooring.<p>
