<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
