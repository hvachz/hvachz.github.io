<p>Fact: Geothermal systems really take in no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are extremely uncommon now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact get rid of countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>Legionella is a parasite of protozoans such as amoeba, and therefore needs conditions suitable for both organisms. The bacterium forms a biofilm which is resistant to chemical and antimicrobial treatments, including chlorine. Remediation for Legionella outbreaks in commercial buildings differ, but typically consist of extremely hot water flushes (160 ° F; 70 ° C), sterilisation of standing water in evaporative cooling basins, replacement of shower heads, and in some cases flushes of heavy metal salts.

<p>Due to the fact that they eliminate moisture from the air, Air conditioners can produce a lot of water.

In reality, some condensate drains have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can likewise puddle around the system or flood the location.
