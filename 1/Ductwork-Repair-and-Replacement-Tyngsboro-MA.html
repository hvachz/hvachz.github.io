<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you would not provide them.  Secondly like prolonged car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the essential skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat clients fairly. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally made the most of. Most companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to correctly service and the unit has been operating problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
