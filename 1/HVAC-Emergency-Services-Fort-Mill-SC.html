<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating devices can last for many years. However if you're experiencing frequent breakdowns or your fuel costs unexpectedly seem greater than normal, it is probably time to think about a new system. New heating equipment is far more effective-- you'll see lower fuel expenses right now, not to mention the cash you'll minimize repair costs. You can probably anticipate to cut your fuel bills in half if your heating system is 25 years old or more.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air conditioning, a ductless system, or a heat pump, whatever needs to be replaced eventually. As devices ages, it ends up being less effective. Central air conditioning systems and heat pumps generally last about 10-15 years. Ductless split systems can last up to twenty years. If your system is near, or past, its anticipated lifespan, replacement might be the most economical solution.<p>

<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a tough job that the employees sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay.
