<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the price great but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
