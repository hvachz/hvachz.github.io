<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace specialists often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Search for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>It is particularly essential to take as many of these actions as possible while you are associated with short-term activities that can create high levels of pollutants-for example, painting, paint removing, heating with kerosene heating systems, cooking, or participating in maintenance and hobby activities such as welding, soldering, or sanding. You might also pick to do a few of these activities outdoors, if you can and if weather condition permits.<p>
