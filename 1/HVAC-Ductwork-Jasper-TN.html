Secondly, if you plan to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, specifically concrete in basements, ensure that an effective moisture barrier is set up prior to installing the carpet. If it becomes wet, do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated.<p>
