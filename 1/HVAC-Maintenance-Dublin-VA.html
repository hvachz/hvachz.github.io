<p>There are many reasons that this can take place. Fortunately is that you can attend to many of these factors by yourself without the requirement to require professional aid.

<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter.

If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
