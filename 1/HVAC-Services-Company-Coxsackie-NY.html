Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the traditional hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut down entirely.<p>
