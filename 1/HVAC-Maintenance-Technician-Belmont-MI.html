<h3>Facts All Belmont MI Homeowners Need To Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>I confess I have not done the mathematics lately, however I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular inspections. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their work with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the system sits. I feel like they provide me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has actually set up both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have actually discovered them to be fairly priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my primary furnace they worked out beyond what was essential and redid the whole plenum and the duct for the water heater due to the fact that the technicians thought they just didn't appear right and they could not leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
