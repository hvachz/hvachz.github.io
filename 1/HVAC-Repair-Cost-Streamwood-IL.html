<p>Asbestos is a mineral fiber that has been utilized frequently in a variety of structure construction products for insulation and as a fire-retardant. EPA and CPSC have prohibited numerous asbestos items. Manufacturers have also willingly restricted uses of asbestos.

<p>Air flow patterns in structure are figured out by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural impacts. Atmospheric pressure differences created by these forces move airborne pollutants from areas of greater pressure to areas of lower pressure through any offered opening in building walls, ceilings, floors, doors, windows, and HVAC systems.

<p>A geothermal heater is more reliable than alternatives, and is not affected by any external factors, unlike other renewable energies such as wind energy and solar power. For example, wind energy can only be used when there is wind, while solar power relies on routine sunshine to work efficiently.

This makes geothermal heating a readily available and reliable  source of energy.<p>
