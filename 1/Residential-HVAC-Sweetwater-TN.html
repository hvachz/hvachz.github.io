You people are officially on speed dial. Speak with you soon.<p>
<p>If the condenser coils are obstructed, the compressor can shut and get too hot down. You'll experience intermittent durations of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are tidy, tidy them again. Switch off the power. Turn the air conditioning service and furnace breaker in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then tug the detach block (Photo 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the cooling service still doesn't work correctly after you've cleaned the condenser coils, set up a new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC won't work completely unless you do this.<p>
