We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are often 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the same toxins. To put it simply, often the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>
<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. A ductless unit has an integrated performance benefit due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leaks in your ducts. Due to the fact that they don't require any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions. Because an unit is set up in each room or location you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that instantly raise the temperature level in the room when you are present.<p>
