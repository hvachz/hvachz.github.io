And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, location two 2x4s beneath the box to raise it up and safeguard it from wetness.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
