<p>Open windows or utilize exhaust fans. Ventilation, a typical technique of reducing exposure to indoor air pollutants, also will decrease but not eliminate direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Natural or mechanical ventilation methods do not eliminate them from the air in your house as quickly as they construct up due to the fact that smoking produces such large quantities of contaminants. In addition, the large boosts in ventilation it requires to considerably reduce exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can also increase energy expenses considerably. Consequently, the most effective method to lower exposure to ecological tobacco smoke in the house is to get rid of smoking there.<p>
