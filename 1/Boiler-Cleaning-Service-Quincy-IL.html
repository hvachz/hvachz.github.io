Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
