<p>Both the evaporator and the condenser are sealed. Therefore, a professional service person ought to be called for nearly any maintenance aside from regular cleaning.

<p>Terrific Item! Shipment was kind of strange being that the box was opened and items could have fell out. However after review of contents we assured it was all intact. The product was extremely lite weight and requires time to apply. Note: buy advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to view the video first prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we dealt with issues. I would suggest this item to anybody who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the very first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to alter your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as vital as a routine oil modification in your cars and truck. A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps pollutants and particles in the air. Energy Star suggests changing your filter as soon as every 3 months. Throughout high usage months, examine the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
