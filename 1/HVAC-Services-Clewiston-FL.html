<h3>HVAC Maintenance Technician in Clewiston Florida</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs quietly and effectively, however to have 2 significant elements stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice before work began. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Great Item! Delivery was kind of strange being that package was opened and items could have fell out. However after review of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The product was extremely lite weight and takes time to use. Keep in mind: purchase suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to see the video first prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had problems with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we dealt with issues. I would recommend this product to anyone who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
<p>Even after performing these tasks to increase the efficiency and longevity of your Seattle HVAC system, you should call in a professional to deal with issues quickly when they develop and perform thorough maintenance once a year or as required.
