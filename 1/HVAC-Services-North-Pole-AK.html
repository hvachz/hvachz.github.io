Start by opening the heat signs up and after that carry on to checking the thermostat settings. Next, inspect the furnace power, reset the furnace or examine the service door cover.

<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is normally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
