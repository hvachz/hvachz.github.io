<p>People working in structures with poor IAQ may discover moldy or undesirable odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are getting worse, talk to your physician about them. However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no replacement for good building management.<p>
