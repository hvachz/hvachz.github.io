<p>All Points Heating uses home a/c, a/c unit installation, air conditioner maintenance that deliver trustworthy, tested performance at high effectiveness. Combustion items from automobile exhaust, furnaces, hot water heater, space heaters, aromatic candle lights, oil lights, wood ranges, fireplaces, and gas stoves that are not appropriately vented can create carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates. These combustion products may lead to nose, eye, and throat irritation; fatigue; lightheadedness; and nausea.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outside unit as close to your house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
