<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the check out. They advised replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a fast internet search validated WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the visit or the brand-new part.
