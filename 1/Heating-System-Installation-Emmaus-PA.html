<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine.

A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine elements. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs handled by experts, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
