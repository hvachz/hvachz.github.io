<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

This might be through a public offering, a sale to a large service in the field, or even a sale to another PE company. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE company Ares Management.
