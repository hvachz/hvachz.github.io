<h3>Install New Air Conditioner in Pittsboro NC 27312</h3>
<p>I normally don't leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You do not expect needing to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
