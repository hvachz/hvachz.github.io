<p>Sean was extremely helpful. He is a really pleasant individual to deal with. No pressure applied to purchase additional things. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no issues besides the blower motor.

That's since it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off prior to it has an opportunity to distribute the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary moisture. The result is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In reality, the space can feel damp and clammy.<p>
