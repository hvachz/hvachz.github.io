<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He understood just what the issue was and repaired it very rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
