<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation.

To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs dealt with by professionals, visit Eric's Garage today.<p>
