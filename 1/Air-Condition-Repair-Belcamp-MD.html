<p>Radiant heating covers a series of various heating unit, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems operate on comparable principles.

<p>Specific instant results resemble those from colds or other viral illness, so it is often difficult to determine if the signs are an outcome of exposure to indoor air contamination. For this reason, it is essential to pay attention to the time and place the signs occur. If the signs fade or disappear when an individual is far from the home and return when the person returns, an effort should be made to recognize indoor air sources that might be possible causes.
