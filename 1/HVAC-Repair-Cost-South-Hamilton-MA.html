<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that repeated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at particular threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and people with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>

<p>Biological pollutants consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transmitted by people and animals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander.

Contaminated central air handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these pollutants through the house.<p>
