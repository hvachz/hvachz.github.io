<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air problems by including new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often produce pollutants.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outside air infiltrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the two ought to not be puzzled. Where a geothermal HVAC use the heat inside the earth for area heating, cooling or for heating one's water system, geothermal energy is the process by which the heat inside the earth is utilized for generating power in the type of electrical power. The two operations use various procedures, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated up to boiling point to achieve its aims.<p>
