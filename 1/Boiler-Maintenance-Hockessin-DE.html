<p>Truth: Geothermal systems actually take in no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that very same aquifer.

When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really eliminate countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
