<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your house at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will require a much bigger AC unit than a smaller house, which will impact installation expenses. Likewise a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air circulation will require far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other elements that can impact this might be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
