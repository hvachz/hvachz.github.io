<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply 8 to 10 years old, it might flatter twice the electricity that even a low-end new one would use. That's due to the fact that it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to offer a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment installed simply a few years earlier.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He knew simply what the issue was and repaired it very quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
