Gas furnace not blowing hot air? Just as with switches, someone might have shut off a gas valve and then forgotten to turn it back on. Trace the gas line back from the furnace to the meter, and if you see a deal with that's perpendicular to the gas pipeline, turn it so it's parallel. Gas furnace repair is depends on how old your furnace is. If you have an old furnace or boiler, you might have a pilot burner.

<p>I'll begin with a gas furnace due to the fact that it's the most common heater in Seattle homes. Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your home by means of ducts, and cool air is collected by means of cold air return vents. Gas heaters are ranked for efficiency. Older units from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is lost throughout the combustion process. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a fairly uncomplicated process. Setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite expensive if you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>
