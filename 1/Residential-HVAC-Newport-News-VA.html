<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 should be calibrated regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors may also be needed.<p>
