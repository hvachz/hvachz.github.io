<h3>Preventive HVAC Care in Sunnyvale CA</h3>
<p>Another technique to lowering the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your home is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming inside. The majority of house heating and cooling systems, including forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather allows, or running a window air conditioner with the vent control open boosts the outdoor ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen fans that tire outdoors remove contaminants straight from the space where the fan is located and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>

Termite damage can be decreased or prevented by ensuring that wood structure materials do not enter into direct contact with the soil and by keeping firewood away from the house.
