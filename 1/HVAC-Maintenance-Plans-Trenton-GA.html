<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit pollutants.)

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
