<p>There are a great deal of benefits to using a radiant heat system over a traditional forced air heating system. Radiant heat systems tend to be a lot more energy effective than other heaters, for one thing. Required air heating systems tend to struggle with things like duct leakages, which rob them of as much as 30% of their output.

<p>As with a lot of house improvement projects, the cost of a full central heater can vary extensively based upon the size of the home. The majority of heating systems will last in between 15 and twenty years. In selecting a furnace, property owners need to think about heat output and performance. Heat output is determined in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace should be matched to the size of the house. A little house, for instance, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the home too quickly and turn off for too long, leading to irregular temperature levels.<p>
