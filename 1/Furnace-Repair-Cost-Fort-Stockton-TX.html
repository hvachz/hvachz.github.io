<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job finding the outside unit as near to your home as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
