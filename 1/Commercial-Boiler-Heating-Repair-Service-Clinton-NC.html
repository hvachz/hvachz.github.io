<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound given that 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one constraint: their total power must not exceed the capacity of the outside system. In practice, nevertheless, it is really common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units higher than the outside capability by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to expect much better efficiency when all indoor systems are switched on at the very same time, given that the total capacity of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outside system. Put simply, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that a few of the rooms may not have a very comfy temperature level. However, the estimation of the total power is not easy, given that it considers not just the nominal power of the units, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

<p>Many people ignore the degree of the indoor air pollution issue. Air pollution is generally visualized as the black smoke produced from factories.

Even if the opening is little, air will move until the inside pressure amounts to the outside.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Reducing pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outside) air to dilute polluted (indoor) air.

Momentarily increasing ventilation combined with proper use of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for example, can be beneficial in diluting the concentration of poisonous fumes in the air.<p>
