<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Radiant heat systems have actually been around since the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floorings and connected them into a warm water supply. Romans utilized a wood-fired boiler tended by servants and an elementary pumping maker to distribute warm water that warmed their stone floors. In turn, the uniformity of the floor heat transferred heat to other articles in the spaces, including the human residents.<p>
