<p>It's not advised for uncertified individuals to repair & examine air conditioning & HVAC devices. There is a danger of electric shock & death if not properly trained in emergency ac repair check-ups. It would be best if you left it to a skilled ac repair Houston Midtown tech for appropriate HVAC medical diagnosis. Always ensure when inspecting your a/c equipment to turn off all primary power from the emergency breaker panel or disconnect switch.

<h3>HVAC Repair And You - What You Need to Understand in Tolland CT</h3>
<p>Factors that can add to the development of biological impurities are wet or wet structure materials (carpets, ceilings, walls) and badly maintained humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioning system. "Humidifier fever" is a typical disease triggered by inappropriate maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and relentless coughs. Different fungis and germs grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these pollutants can be dispersed into the air and inhaled by the building residents. Other possible sources of biological impurities are family pets and household plants.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
