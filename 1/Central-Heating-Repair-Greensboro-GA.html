<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was quick and really clear about his assessment, ensuring I comprehended what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>I have actually become reasonably skilled at looking into items on line prior to buying them. However I do not find that there is a central place for searching info about the "true" worth of home HVAC systems or possibly I must say a sincere assessment of these products. Since I reside in FL it is important to have a great AC system in your home due to the fact that they are truly taxed in the summer.<p>
