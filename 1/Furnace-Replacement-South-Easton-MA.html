<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the typical house. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the inbound air is decreased, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be rather considerable if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are typically described as merely glowing systems.

When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heat.<p>
