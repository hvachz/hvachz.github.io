<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO maintain the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, numerous studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. Nevertheless, pick your contractor sensibly, many of the 'respectable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed house owners.

While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a credible company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
