CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system parts, and pollutant sources.

<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Items HVAC Repairin Carol Stream IL</h3>
<p>The kinds of heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are as different as the different homes they serve (single household homes, duplexes, mobile houses, apartments, high-rise condos, row real estate, and so on). No matter what the type of home HVAC system, sufficient air flow (ventilation), appropriate filtering, and humidity control all add to a healthy indoor air environment. > Also, frequent maintenance of the HVAC system will ensure that it is running securely and not contributing to or causing an indoor air issue.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix utilized in autos in the U.S. until 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and used by certified HVAC service technicians. For systems needing just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by numerous individuals.<p>
