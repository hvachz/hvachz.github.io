<p>Details provided in this security guide is based on present scientific and technical understanding of the problems presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional boundaries established by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. Structures constantly evolve as an outcome of the modifications in the environment around them as well as the residents, products, and activities within them. The different surface areas and the air inside a structure are constantly communicating, and this interaction results in modifications in each. For instance, we might see a window as altering slightly with time as it ends up being filthy, then is cleaned, builds up dirt again, is cleaned once again, and so on through its life. In fact, the dirt" we see might be evolving as a result of the interactions among the moisture, chemicals, and biological products discovered there.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Dirty filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too quickly, and your house won't heat up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A dirty filter likewise causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

Dripping return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Once again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
