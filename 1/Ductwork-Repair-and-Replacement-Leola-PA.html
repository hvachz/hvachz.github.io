<p>These people have actually been terrific. At a real estate agent, I in some cases need contractors to give me a viewpoint for what deal with a house might cost.

<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably the same physical material in time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
