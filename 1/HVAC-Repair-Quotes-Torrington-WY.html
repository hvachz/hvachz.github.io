<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you need to examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
