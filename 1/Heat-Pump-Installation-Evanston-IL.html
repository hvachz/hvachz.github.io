<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones, the main issue. While setting up a separate split system, employees attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little.

<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either because of noticeable growth or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and check. Leaking return ducts can likewise present moisture. Once again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>Some diseases, like humidifier fever, are related to exposure to toxins from bacteria that can grow in large building ventilation systems.
