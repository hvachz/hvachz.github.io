<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act similar to conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. A ducted heatpump system may be most budget-friendly if your home or structure has an existing duct system that remains in good condition. Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the need to set up a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still necessary to have a specialist technician check the system periodically.<p>
