<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Design, Building And Construction and Commissioning is created for architects, design engineers, contractors, commissioning representatives, and all other experts worried about indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the house include structure materials, cigarette smoking, home products, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene space heating systems.

<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outside unit as near to your home as possible per my request.

He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
