<p>Customer products which contain methylene chloride consist of paint strippers, adhesive removers, and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is understood to cause cancer in animals.

<p>Usually the most effective method to improve indoor air quality is to remove private sources of contamination or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adapted to reduce the amount of emissions. In many cases, source control is also a more affordable approach to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your house are noted later on in this area.<p>
<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical product with time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
