<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â The majority of heating systems have multiple control boards. The largest, or just one in some heating systems, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and collaborate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, however the new control panel should be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the concern isnâ $ t effectively identified, changing a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable as soon as installed. Itâ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a professional to detect.<p>
