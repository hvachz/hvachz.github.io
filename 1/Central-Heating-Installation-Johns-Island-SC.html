<p>Great Item! Shipment was kind of weird being that package was opened and products might have fell out. However after review of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The product was extremely lite weight and takes time to apply. Note: buy recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we resolved concerns. I would suggest this product to anyone who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the first time.
