<p>The quality of the air inside our homes, schools and workplaces matters, especially because we spend most of our lives inside. Ac system help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in extremely humid environments or in cases where the air conditioning system is oversized, it may not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the a/c unit will need more energy to cool your home. A more effective option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the primary issue. While setting up a separate split system, workers attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system develops more problems, considering that some of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the a/c separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor units run separately from each other.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited making use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline prohibited making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that equipment that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
