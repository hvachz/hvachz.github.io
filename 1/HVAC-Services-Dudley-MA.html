<p>Central air conditioning units are determined in heaps. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 lot system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs.

<p>I am very impressed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call organisation several years earlier and know the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also pleased that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
