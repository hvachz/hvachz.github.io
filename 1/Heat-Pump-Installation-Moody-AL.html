<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of different heating systems, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems run on comparable concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by distributing warm water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements.
