<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' kind of maintenance as I've read here).

So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
