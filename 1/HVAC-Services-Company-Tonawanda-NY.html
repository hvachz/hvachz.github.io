<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
