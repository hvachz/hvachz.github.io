<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the price great but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
