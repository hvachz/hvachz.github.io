<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a credible company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Your furnace is an investment; if treated right, it might heat your house for many years without problems. If left ignored, a furnace is susceptible to breakdowns, performance problems, and catastrophic failures, which might lead to severe emergency situations. Our local furnace maintenance professionals are ready to provide your furnace with the attention it requires to last for several years to come. We offer a range of maintenance plans to fit all spending plans and needs.<p>
