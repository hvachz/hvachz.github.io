(If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI safeguarded.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
<p>Regularly, indoor air quality problems in large commercial structures can not be successfully determined or remedied without a detailed structure examination.
