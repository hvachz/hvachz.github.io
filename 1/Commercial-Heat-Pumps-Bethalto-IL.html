<p>Biological impurities consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and people; germs are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Polluted central air handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these contaminants through the house.<p>
