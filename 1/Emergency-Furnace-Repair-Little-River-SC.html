<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
