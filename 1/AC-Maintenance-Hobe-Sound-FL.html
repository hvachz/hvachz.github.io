<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. These convection heaters are still extensively utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, understand that there are maintenance items that just a skilled HVAC technician will have the ability to do.

While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still essential to have an expert technician inspect the system occasionally.<p>
