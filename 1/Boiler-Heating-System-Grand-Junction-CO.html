<p>The impacts of lead exposure on fetuses and children can be serious. They consist of hold-ups in physical and mental advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Kids, fetuses, and infants are more vulnerable to lead direct exposure than adults given that lead is more easily absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of kids are more sensitive to the destructive effects of lead. Children might have greater exposures given that they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>
