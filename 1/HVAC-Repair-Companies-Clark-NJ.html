<p>Indoor impurities. These include chemicals utilized in the building or renovation of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Incomplete combustion and poor ventilation of these home appliances (cook stoves, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor impurities.
