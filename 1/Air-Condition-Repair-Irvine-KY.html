<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>Duct are responsible for distributing hot and cold air throughout your home, providing a comfortable environment in every room. However ducts that are not set up properly or maintained can distribute pollutants from one space to another. Gradually, dust, dander and even mold can collect in your ducts, lowering the total air quality. Employ an expert to ensure your ducts are circulating fresh, tidy air.<p>
