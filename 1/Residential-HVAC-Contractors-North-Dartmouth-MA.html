<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act much like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. If your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most cost effective. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to set up an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Frequently, indoor air quality problems in big commercial structures can not be efficiently determined or corrected without a thorough structure investigation. These investigations may start with written questionnaires and telephone assessments in which building investigators evaluate the history of occupant symptoms and structure operation treatments. In some cases, these queries may quickly uncover the issue and on-site sees are unnecessary.<p>

A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, including installation. Whole-house systems, on the other hand, variety in rate from $2,500 to $7,500, including installation.
