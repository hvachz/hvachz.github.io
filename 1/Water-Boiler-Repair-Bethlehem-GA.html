<p>Instantaneous discount rates on high-efficiency heat pump innovations are offered to devices installers, used at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Excellent Customer Service! Climate Pro is reliable and genuinely cared about us and our scenario. We came home one evening to a cold house. I called Climate Pro, and Warren came over that very same night. Although he didn't have the required replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he might try to find and buy it the next morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was definitely grateful to have a heated house again. What's most incredible was that this all happened during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd discover someone to help us right prior to a holiday, however Climate Pro came through for us. I will happily recommend this company to my friends.<p>
