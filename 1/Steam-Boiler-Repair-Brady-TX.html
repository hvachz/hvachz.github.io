<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sterilizing services are categorized as a Vital Business in Los Angeles. Switched to using Wachoff's about a year back and they've been to your house for a system tune-up 3 times now. They're priced fairly, have dealt with the one repair I required well, and are constantly on-time and professional. Have actually been through a few companies over the years and Wachoff's is definitely the very best I have actually had the opportunity to work with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has been fantastic.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the cost terrific but Mark went out of his way to personalize a few things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
