If the air filter is great to go, check the furnace blower for blocking and clean it. If this does not work, take a look at the furnace blower motor and oil it. Get in touch with a skilled technician if you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has actually installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have found them to be fairly priced, timely and do fine work.

No extra charge.<p>
