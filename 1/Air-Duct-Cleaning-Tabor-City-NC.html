<h3>What to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service in Tabor City NC</h3>
<p>One of the main factors a furnace will run constantly is since something is filthy or blocked Prior to attempting to fix any problem, take some time to make sure that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan". If the air filter is great to go, check the furnace blower for blocking and clean it. If this does not work, take a look at the furnace blower motor and oil it. Get in touch with a skilled technician if you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has actually installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have found them to be fairly priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was needed and redid the entire plenum and the duct for the hot water heater since the professionals thought they just didn't appear ideal and they could not leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
