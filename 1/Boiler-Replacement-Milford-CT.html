<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not use auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of money coming in each month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>

Protexs deal was among the couple of affordable ones received. Others were nearly twice the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand name equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex effectively recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up team was respectful of my home and set up the equipment in the anticipated amount of time. post set up examination outcomes look very good for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools better than the 13 years of age 4 load R22 unit it replaced (also Carrier).<p>

I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
