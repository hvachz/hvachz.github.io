<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably the same physical material with time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
