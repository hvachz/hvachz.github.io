<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you must examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
