<p>Certain immediate impacts are similar to those from colds or other viral illness, so it is frequently difficult to identify if the signs are a result of direct exposure to indoor air pollution. For this reason, it is important to pay attention to the time and location the signs take place. If the signs fade or disappear when an individual is away from the home and return when the person returns, an effort needs to be made to determine indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some impacts may be worsened by an insufficient supply of outside air or from the cooling, humidity, or heating conditions common in the home.<p>
<p>Some health effects can be helpful indications of an indoor air quality problem, especially if they appear after an individual transfers to a new house, remodels or refurnishes a home, or treats a home with pesticides.

You may also wish to speak with a board-certified allergist or an occupational medicine specialist for responses to your questions.<p>
