<p>Another alternative to oil furnaces are gas heaters While oil is traditionally used in locations where gas lines do not run, there are times when you may have an option between the 2 types. Gas heaters cost about the exact same, approximately $6,000 for a high-efficiency system. The real benefit of using a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your house.

<h3>Benefits of Professional AC Repair in Rocky Face GA</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>The primary step to fixing any problem is identifying what the problem is in the first place. If we find your system needs a major repair, we waive our diagnostic charges. The parts we utilize are backed up with a two-year parts service warranty when we do any repair. If you've spoken to another company and got a quote, our diagnostics service and waived charge supply you with a 2nd choice that includes the guarantee reward.<p>
