<p>The main issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, workers attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system produces more troubles, given that some of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the a/c individually for each space. However, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>
