<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the rate terrific but Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<h3>Working of an HVAC System at Winona MS</h3>
<p>The majority of people don't know how humidity is eliminated from your Houston Midtown Tx home. The evaporator HVAC coil in your attic likewise acts a dehumidifier. All the wet hot air that travels through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then removed from the space that is being cooled. If your HVAC unit is not draining pipes appropriately, you'll have a water leak. A constraint in your drainage pipelines triggers a water leak. There are many different places an obstruction can happen. One of the main areas where blockages begin to establish is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
