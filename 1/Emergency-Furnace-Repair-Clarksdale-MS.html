<p>When mounting a wall sensor, consider the height at which they should be put. Many frequently they are installed at height-level or somewhat lower, if people mostly remain seated in that specific area. Nevertheless, the molecular weight of some substances makes them gravitate towards the flooring or ceiling; depending on what toxin you're trying to track you'll need to place the sensing unit appropriately. For example, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air therefore the highest concentrations inside structures are typically near the ceiling. Conversely, ozone is heavier than air and stays near the floor.<p>
