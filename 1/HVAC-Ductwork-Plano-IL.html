<p>Today, millions of dust mites, dead skin cells, building and construction particles, and mold might be living in your home's duct, impacting the air you breathe along with the performance of your heating and a/c system. There are numerous style approaches in usage today; however, all ground source heatpump operate with similar principles. Each one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop between the surface systems and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These various heat sources also dictate the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer using an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat utilizing a closed loop.<p>
<p>The first a/c unit and refrigerators utilized harmful or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could lead to fatal accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion home and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
