<p>We look at clues before we provide guidance to change rather than repair a heating unit. One of the hints we look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy costs are higher year after year, we know the unit is not running effectively. It might be in best condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more effective model, then you would be squandering money by not replacing the older system.<p>
<p>With the cost of electrical energy and gas increasing, it's important to have your furnace tuned-up for maximum energy savings. This will keep you from needlessly paying more than you should. Paragon Heating & House Convenience Solutions Combustion Optimization & Security Evaluation of your furnace consists of a Performance Check-Up, in which the thermostat is checked for accuracy and the burners are changed for optimal efficiency. Apotheosis Heating & Home Comfort Solutions DOES NOT utilize the ineffective 'eyeball the flame' method that other companies utilize. Rather, the combustion is enhanced by determining the exhaust gasses and making scientific modifications. This alone could spend for the entire maintenance go to at today's price of natural gas.<p>
<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They provide me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a brand-new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended service warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
