<p>The icing problem ends up being far more severe with lower outside temperature levels, so heat pumps are commonly installed in tandem with a more traditional type of heating, such as an electrical heating unit, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used instead of the heat pump during harsher winter season temperature levels. In this case, the heat pump is utilized effectively throughout the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the standard heat source when the outdoor temperature is lower.<p>
