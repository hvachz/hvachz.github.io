<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide ought to be calibrated frequently, and outdoor measurements used for calculations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors may also be necessary.<p>
<p>People working in buildings with poor IAQ may discover undesirable or musty smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your doctor about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no alternative to great structure management.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating adequate outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
