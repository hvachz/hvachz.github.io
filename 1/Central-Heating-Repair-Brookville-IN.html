<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts years, considering that it is safeguarded indoors. When it does need to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical standards get rid of the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat with time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
<p>If your single phase ac system isn't old enough to justify replacement, think about an entire house dehumidifier. By setting up dehumidification equipment inside an existing single stage system, you can enjoy a few of the advantages of a variable speed compressor without changing any equipment. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfy level, improving indoor air quality and allowing greater convenience at higher temperature levels.<p>
