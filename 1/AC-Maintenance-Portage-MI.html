<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How climate modification affects air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for modern-day a/c unit) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the ac system boost.

As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
