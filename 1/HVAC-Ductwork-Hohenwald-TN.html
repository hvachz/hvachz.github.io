<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for modern air conditioners) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c unit increase. This increase has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
