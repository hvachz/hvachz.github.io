<p>A packaged system, generally set up on the roofing system, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, however it is likewise an option for property owners to think about. Often times, these systems contain not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those seeking to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system individually, considering that the unit is combined. However, one con is that these systems are normally only offered for bigger homes due to their high power and capacity. In addition, while they can be a good way to conserve money on a total HVAC system, they're still significantly more expensive than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best option for house owners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>
