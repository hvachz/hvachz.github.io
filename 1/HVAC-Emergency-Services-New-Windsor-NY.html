<p>G&S did an exceptional job installing our new furnace and AC unit. The very best thing about G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Producers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their warranty. Also they detected the concern and repaired really quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>

He clearly and completely explained all problems and repairs in a way that made me confident in his ability to resolve my repair issues. He followed through and went the extra mile to personally get a required part that was not in stock, ensuring repairs were made so that my spouse and I would not need to withstand another night without heat, during one of the coldest winters in recent memory. He also reacted to my call right away the next morning, and coached me through a short-term fix to a problem that could not be solved on the very first visit due to not available parts. I trust Nick's abilities, experience and ability to deliver consistent, quality service.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine components. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs handled by specialists, see Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
