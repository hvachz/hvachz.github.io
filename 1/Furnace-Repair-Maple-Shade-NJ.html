<h3>Ventilation Double Flux in Maple Shade NJ 08052</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
