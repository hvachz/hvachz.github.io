After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, measured particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

In addition, the big increases in ventilation it takes to considerably lower exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can also increase energy costs considerably. As a result, the most efficient way to decrease exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the home is to remove smoking cigarettes there.<p>
