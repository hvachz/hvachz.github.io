<p>For every load of laundry you dry, that wetness needs to go somewhere. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply requesting for mold buildup, says Dr. Khatri.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid figure out the efficiency of dilution.

Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness. The objective is to supply adequate modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this. A common component essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
