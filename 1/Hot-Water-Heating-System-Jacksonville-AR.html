<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in buildings through mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated without being available in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct, supplying warm air to individual bed rooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
