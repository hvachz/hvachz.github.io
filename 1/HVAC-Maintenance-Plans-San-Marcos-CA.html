<h3>Outdoor Air Conditioner in San Marcos California</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the home.<p>

<p>Some biological contaminants set off allergies, consisting of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some kinds of asthma. Infectious health problems, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transferred through the air. Molds and mildews release disease-causing toxic substances. Symptoms of health issue caused by biological toxins consist of sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, dizziness, lethargy, fever, and gastrointestinal problems.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you must inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
