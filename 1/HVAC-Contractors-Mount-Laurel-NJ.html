<p>Your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a range of impurities that have the possible to adversely impact your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungis, germs, and really small particles of dust.

The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion home and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
