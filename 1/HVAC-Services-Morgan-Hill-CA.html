<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
