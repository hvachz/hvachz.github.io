When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
