<p>RMI is working to change that, starting in California. As an initial step, in April RMI affirmed prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set more powerful indoor guidelines based on the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to control indoor appliances through codes, and after more powerful standards are set there is an opportunity to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that repeated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at specific danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and people with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
<p>Heating is also among the biggest energy customers in your home, so house owners who may be looking for a brand-new furnace should considering changing it with a more recent, more energy-efficient design to save cash and assist the environment. The typical furnace lasts in between 15 and 20 years, so you're making a substantial investment in your home. Spend carefully by learning as much as you can about available options.<p>
<p>Depending upon where in the United States your home lies, the local region's environment can change drastically. A house located in the South would require an AC unit with a size capable of cooling your home due to heat Summers. A home in the Northern part of the US would require a much larger heating capability too which will impact expenses. See the chart listed below for the average central air conditioning conditioner replacement expenses by LOTS.<p>
