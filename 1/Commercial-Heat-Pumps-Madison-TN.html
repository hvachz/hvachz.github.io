<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not provide car debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash being available in monthly, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to offer automobile debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There ought to not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
