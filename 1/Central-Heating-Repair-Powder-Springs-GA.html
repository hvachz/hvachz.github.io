<h3>AC Service in Powder Springs Georgia</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the home.<p>
<p>There is a needed balance in making your decision though as systems with higher AFUE rankings typically feature greater cost.

<p>Both must be kept clean since an air conditioner moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outside coil. This suggests that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise essential to frequently clean up the condenser coil.
