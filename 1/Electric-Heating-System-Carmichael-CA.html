<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his staff members, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other expenses prior to paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, specifically if the goal of owning a service was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% wants the couple of years it took to construct the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't the end objective.
