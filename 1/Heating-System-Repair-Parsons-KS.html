My better half said that she had actually seen an excellent evaluation for James, so I called. He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and described the situation to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He offered to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the nicest, most good people I have satisfied in a long time.
