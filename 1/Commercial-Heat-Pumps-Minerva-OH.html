<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs quietly and efficiently, however to have 2 major parts stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the billing prior to work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

While the duct-cleaning market argues both studies have defects, no other research has actually challenged the findings. And although the devices and techniques utilized by duct-cleaning companies have changed since these research studies were carried out, the duct in homes haven't.<p>
