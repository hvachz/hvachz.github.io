<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 rule however got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>G&S did an exceptional job installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The best aspect of G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Producers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Likewise they detected the issue and fixed very rapidly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
