<h3>Common Causes of Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Center TX</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping between a outside and indoor system rather of ducting air directly from the outside unit. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct manage air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
