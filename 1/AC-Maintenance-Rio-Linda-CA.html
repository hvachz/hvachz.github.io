<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets requests for consultation and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. The possibility of instant reactions to indoor air toxins depends on a number of aspects including age and preexisting medical conditions. In many cases, whether an individual reacts to a contaminant depends on individual level of sensitivity, which differs significantly from person to person. Some people can become sensitized to chemical or biological toxins after duplicated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>Radiant heat offers a number of special advantages over forced air heater. For instance, radiant heat systems are more energy effective than forced air systems. They do not have to stress over duct leaks, which are accountable for output losses of as much as 30% in other heater types. Transferring heat through solid things will also trigger it to last longer than using air as a thermal medium. A house heated up by a glowing system will heat up much faster, and stay warm with less energy spent. These are simply a few of the lots of benefits that a radiant heat system can use you.<p>
