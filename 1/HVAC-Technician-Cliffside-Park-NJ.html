<p>Your air, heating, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a range of pollutants that have the potential to adversely impact your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungis, germs, and very little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should examine and, if essential, update the building envelope. For instance, he might seal spaces and fractures in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating costs. Insulation may be a more reliable solution to your cooling issues than changing your devices.<p>
