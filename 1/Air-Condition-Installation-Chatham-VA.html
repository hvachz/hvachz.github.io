<p>Central air conditioning units are determined in tons. This measurement is based upon the system's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 load system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it means the quantity of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Often, indoor air quality issues in large commercial structures can not be successfully determined or remedied without a comprehensive structure examination. These investigations may begin with written questionnaires and telephone assessments in which structure private investigators assess the history of occupant signs and structure operation treatments. In some cases, these inquiries may quickly reveal the problem and on-site sees are unneeded.<p>
<p>Typically the most efficient way to improve indoor air quality is to eliminate specific sources of pollution or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be adapted to decrease the quantity of emissions.
