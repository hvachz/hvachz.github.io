<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you must inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
