<p>The exhaust outlets allow all dangerous gases to leave your property so there's no dangerous buildup of carbon monoxide and other such gases. They can lead to a hazardous accumulation and compromise your safety if the exhaust outlets are obstructed.

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by building and construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
