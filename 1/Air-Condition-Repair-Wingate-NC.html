<p>I have actually been using them for years for my businesses, my own houses and my property clients' houses. I went through five other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who described to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. When I called and he recommended me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again, he assisted me trouble shoot the issue. He is sincere, trusted, and reasonable on price. It's difficult to discover an honest AC man and I'm glad I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
<p>The installation was quickly, expert and effectively done. The installers were polite and knew exactly what to do.
