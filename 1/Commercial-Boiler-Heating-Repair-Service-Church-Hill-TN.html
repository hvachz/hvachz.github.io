<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
