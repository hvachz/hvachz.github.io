<p>Immediate discounts on high-efficiency heat pump innovations are readily available to equipment installers, applied at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Outstanding Customer Service! Climate Pro is reputable and really appreciated us and our scenario. We came home one evening to a cold home. I called Environment Pro, and Warren came by that very same night. Although he didn't have the needed replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he might look for and purchase it the next early morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was absolutely appreciative to have a heated home again. What's most amazing was that this all happened throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find someone to assist us right before a vacation, but Climate Pro came through for us. I will gladly advise this company to my friends.<p>
