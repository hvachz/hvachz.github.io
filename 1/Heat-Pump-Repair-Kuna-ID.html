<p>Expert heating system setups. However, even the best-maintained heating system will eventually stop working. HVAC experts suggest following this standard rule when choosing whether it's worth buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost over half the cost of a new system, it's finest to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have much more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than necessary.<p>
