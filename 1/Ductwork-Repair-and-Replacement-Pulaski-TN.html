<p>Recent Review: They were excellent! A lot of HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally requested. They fulfilled my requirements entirely by providing an expert quote with alternatives, without pressing extra products. The team showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and finished a little early. The also immediately followed up with the needed evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly advise this company.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air due to the fact that my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung out repairing the issue, all the while discussing whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working properly. He needed to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
