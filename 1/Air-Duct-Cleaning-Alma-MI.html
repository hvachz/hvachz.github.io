<h3>Electric Furnace in Alma Michigan</h3>
<p>Usually, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. If your AC unit is frosty, the evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. Also, if the ac system smells bad, there might be bacteria accumulation on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil takes in the heat far from your house. It will take from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to change the air conditioner's evaporator coil.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply eight to 10 years old, it could suck up to two times the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's because it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to provide a specific cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment installed just a couple of years earlier.<p>
