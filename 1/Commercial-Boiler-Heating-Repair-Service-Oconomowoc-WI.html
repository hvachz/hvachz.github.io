If the air filter is great to go, inspect the furnace blower for clogging and tidy it. If this does not work, take a look at the furnace blower motor and lube it. Call a knowledgeable technician if you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running.<p>
<p>Inspect these 3 things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in the house are large open.

If a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the minimized airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You have actually resolved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
