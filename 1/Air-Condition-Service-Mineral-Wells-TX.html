<p>Since it's the most common heating system in Seattle homes, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the spaces of your home by means of ducts, and cool air is collected by means of cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are ranked for effectiveness. Older systems from the 1970s might be rated 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is squandered throughout the combustion procedure. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%.

<p>For contaminants aside from radon, measurements are most appropriate when there are either health signs or indications of bad ventilation and particular sources or toxins have been determined as possible reasons for indoor air quality problems. Testing for many pollutants can be costly. Prior to monitoring your home for toxins besides radon, consult your state or local health department or professionals who have experience in solving indoor air quality problems in nonindustrial structures.<p>
