<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have problems, they give me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy prolonged service warranties or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I don't need.<p>
