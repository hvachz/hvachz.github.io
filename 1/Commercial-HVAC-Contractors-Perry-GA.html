<p>Your lungs are accountable for bringing fresh air into your body, while simultaneously getting rid of waste gases and particulates. Needless to state, the more particles that are in the air you breathe, the harder it is for your lungs to eliminate them. Poor air quality - whether it is inside or outdoors - can make it significantly difficult for your lungs to function appropriately, and can have unfavorable health affects.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
