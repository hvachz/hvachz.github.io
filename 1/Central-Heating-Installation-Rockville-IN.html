<p>Inspect these three things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the registers in your house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the lowered air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You have actually solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
