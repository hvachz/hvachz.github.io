<p>An indoor air contaminant is a substance in the air that might impact the health of individuals who reside in the house. Toxins could come from outside the home-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in an attached garage, backyard trash burning, or radon entering your house from the ground below. An air toxin could also originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a defective furnace, unstable natural substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted space, secondhand smoke, mold growing on damp or wet carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, household cleaning, or personal care items. Viruses and bacteria, pet dander, and pest parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>

<p>If you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heater, think about possible effects of indoor air contamination. Follow the manufacturer's directions, especially instructions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heating system properly adjusted. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is typically a sign of maladjustment and increased toxin emissions. While a space heating unit remains in usage, open a door from the space where the heater is located to the rest of the house and open a window somewhat.<p>
