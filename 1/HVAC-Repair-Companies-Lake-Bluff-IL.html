<p>Fantastic service within 24 hr and a reasonable cost. The technician (Camryn) was extremely comprehensive and on-time in explaining what services would be performed. Also Camryn offered great customer support at the end of the consultation by discussing precisely what he had actually done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a couple of recommendations of some maintenance tasks we might want to have done in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale tactics used by some in the industry.<p>

<p>Keep an eye out for signs of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous products, floor, wall, and ceiling coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to 48 hours may end up being a source for mold development and need to be disposed of.

If a source of water or condensation can be discovered, opportunities exist will be mold growing close by. Repair the moisture problem, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly clean the location utilizing recognized health department suggestions.<p>
