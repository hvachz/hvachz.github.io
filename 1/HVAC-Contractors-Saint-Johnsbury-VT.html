<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act similar to conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. A ducted heat pump system may be most affordable if your house or building has an existing duct system that is in good condition. Using existing ductwork will remove the need to install an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>Air toxins can range from pollutants brought in from the outdoors by your pets to dangerous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide gas is a common air contaminant resulting from gas that gets away into your house without being burnt. Older houses may contain asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when released into the air. In bathrooms and kitchen areas, mold and mildew can end up being an annoyance where moisture levels are usually higher than in the rest of your house.<p>

When asbestos-containing materials are harmed or disrupted by repair, redesigning, or demolition activities, tiny fibers can become airborne if correct controls are not in location. This can result in the potential for significant health problems.<p>
