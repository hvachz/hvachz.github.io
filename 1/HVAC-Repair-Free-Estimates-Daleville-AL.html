<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
