<h3>Air Duct Cleaning in Palos Hills IL 60465</h3>
<p>If you set it too low, you're encouraging the development of mold in wet air. The heat dries out the air, avoiding mold growth and contamination. Naturally, too-dry air can also irritate your lungs and sinuses, while excessive indoor humidity can contribute to the growth of bacteria and infections, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Health and Environmental Health. The ideal humidity in a home is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that duplicated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. People at particular risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and individuals with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>Many people are ending up being more worried and conscious about their health and the effect of indoor air quality. Dust and dirt consisting of contaminants and irritants can cover the cooling ductwork with time. Sometimes it needs to be removed to boost and refresh the quality of indoor air and improve the cooling. Beacon Plumbing, Seattle, WA cleans the duct physically by getting rid of the debris from the air filter.<p>
<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung out fixing the issue, all the while describing everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working effectively. He had to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
