<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a difficult job that the employees sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with customers and keeps men working. When a sales guy concerns your house he exists to offer, that is the only way he is paid. You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and should not "need" to sell you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I offer you the choices for your needs and you decide if you require it.<p>

<h3>Components of a High Efficiency Furnace in Wilson NC</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping between a outside and indoor system instead of ducting air straight from the outdoor unit. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He understood just what the problem was and repaired it very rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>Irritants are products that cause an immune-type reaction in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Allergens discovered in indoor air are primarily biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can end up being airborne, and thus, are easily breathed in. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For instance, if you think of a group of people with asthma, the existence of cat irritant could bring on an asthma attack in people with feline allergic reactions, but not in those people who do not have cat allergies.<p>
<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung out fixing the problem, all the while discussing whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working effectively. He needed to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will definitely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
