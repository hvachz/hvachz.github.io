<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why spaces warmed by radiators are susceptible to cold areas", implying that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and very hot beside the radiators. This typically results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your home escape out of the window. Convected heat provides warmth from the flooring up throughout the room with no cold areas or stuffiness in the location being heated.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more challenging to manage than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity needs to be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to reduce mold development.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you may select to change the outdoor compressor with a modern, high-efficiency system. If you do so, speak with a local heating and cooling contractor to ensure that the brand-new compressor is properly matched to the indoor unit. However, considering current changes in refrigerants and air conditioning styles, it might be better to change the entire system.<p>
