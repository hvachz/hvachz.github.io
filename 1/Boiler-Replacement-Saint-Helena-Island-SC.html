<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you must inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
