<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The very same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
