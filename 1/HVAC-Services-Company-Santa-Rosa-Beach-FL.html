<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace service technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Try to find a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

However, there are times when an easy maintenance call can determine a problem that will need a significant investment to fix. Then, it's decision time.

The decision to replace or repair is up to you, and typically it refers comparing the cost to repair, considering the age of the devices, versus the cost of a new furnace that likely offers greater energy efficiency and includes guarantee protection.<p>
