Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts.

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- because they can be breathed in.
