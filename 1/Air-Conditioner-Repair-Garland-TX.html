<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
