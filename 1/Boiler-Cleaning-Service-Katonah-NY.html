PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have 2 separate systems (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This decreases the interior system footprint and allows each space to be changed independently. PTAC systems might be adjusted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioning system into a heatpump While room cooling supplies optimum versatility, when utilized to cool many spaces at a time it is generally more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
