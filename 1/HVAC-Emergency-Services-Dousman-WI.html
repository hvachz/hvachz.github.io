<p>Appropriate ventilation assists enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are frequently 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and sometimes these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the same toxins. To put it simply, often the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>
<p>The first air conditioning system and fridges used poisonous or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could result in fatal accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion house and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
