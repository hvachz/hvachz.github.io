<p>I have been using them for several years for my businesses, my own homes and my realty customers' houses. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various prices and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental home. He helped me trouble shoot the issue when I called and he advised me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again. He is sincere, trustworthy, and sensible on cost. It's difficult to discover an honest AC man and I'm pleased I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me concerning an abnormally high costs that I got blindsided by BEFORE he knew that I had called the service manager and left a message of concern. Ron had actually identified the trouble area in looking over the bill. He resolved the concern in one day, had changed the bill to what I thought about fair before he called back, knew what might have triggered the issue and had a plan to insure that it would not take place once again. I have considered All Points a company with stability for the nine years we have actually used them. This experience validates that.<p>
