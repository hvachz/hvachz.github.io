<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, employees attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system develops more troubles, given that some of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the cooling separately for each space. However, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>
