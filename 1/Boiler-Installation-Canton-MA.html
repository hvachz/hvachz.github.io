<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Convected heat systems have actually been around considering that the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipes under their marble floors and connected them into a hot water supply.

<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to discover an area that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Don't position the condenser under a deck or totally enclose it since it tires warm air out the top. Any air flow constraint will lower the unit's performance. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily flow around it.<p>
<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are vulnerable to cold spots", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and very hot next to the radiators. This usually results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to heat up the house escape out of the window. Convected heat offers warmth from the floor up throughout the room without any cold areas or stuffiness in the location being heated up.<p>
