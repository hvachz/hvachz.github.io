<p>The bureau jobs 34 percent work growth for HVAC professionals between 2010 and 2020, more than two times the average for all professions. A number of elements add to this, consisting of the replacement and upgrade of older a/c systems to meet more stringent ecological guidelines.

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you should check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
