We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are often 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same toxins. In other words, often the air inside can be more hazardous than the air outside.<p>
<p>Rising energy expenses are not the only factor for high bills. Heaters often lose their effectiveness as they age, especially if they have not been appropriately preserved. As a result your oil or natural gas furnace might run longer to provide the exact same amount of heat. This will trigger your energy bills to go up. And, all of the money you pay your energy utility companies monthly could be utilized to help you pay for a brand-new, far more energy-efficient and energy saving furnace. Start to compare the cost of your current heating bills with heating bills from the previous years. If there is a considerable difference, then it's time to change your furnace.<p>

<p>The residential or commercial properties and structure of the soil in an area can affect the rate at which heat is carried out through the ground. These need to be considered before selecting the very best design of an underground heating and cooling system. Soil with favorable heat transfer homes needs less pipes to achieve the wanted underground heating and cooling effect, while those with lowered thermal conductivity will require more pipes.<p>
<p>Asthmatic kids are especially at threat. EPA estimates that exposure to previously owned smoke increases the number of episodes and severity of signs in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic kids, and may cause thousands of nonasth-matic children to develop the disease each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition made worse by exposure to secondhand smoke each year. Exposure to previously owned smoke triggers nose, eye, and throat inflammation. It might affect the cardiovascular system and some research studies have actually connected direct exposure to pre-owned smoke with the start of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Info Clearinghouse (IAQ INFORMATION), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
