<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help identify the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness, Air cleaning occurs. The objective is to supply adequate modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this. A common aspect essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
