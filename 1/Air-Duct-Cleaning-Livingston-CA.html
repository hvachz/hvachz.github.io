<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wood floor joist system, below the wooded subsurface and last floor surface. This is generally used in a third-floor or 2nd area and takes advantage of the floor joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and extra thickness of an in-screed concrete put. To make an under-timber radiant flooring heat hydronic system efficient, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipelines to direct heat upward.<p>
