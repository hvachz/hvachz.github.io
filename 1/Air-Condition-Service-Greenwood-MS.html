<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. A ductless system has an integrated effectiveness benefit since up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leakages in your ducts. Because they do not require any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions.

During high usage months, inspect the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>

My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
