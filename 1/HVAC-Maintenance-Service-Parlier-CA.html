<p>. Prior to choosing the installation place of air conditioner, numerous main aspects need to be considered. Firstly, the direction of air flow from the indoor systems should not fall on the place of rest or work area. Second of all, there must not be any challenges on the way of the airflow that might avoid it from covering the area of the facilities as much as possible. The outside unit must also be located in an open space, otherwise the heat from your home will not be successfully discharged outdoors and the productivity of the entire system will drop dramatically. It is extremely suggested to set up the air conditioning system systems in quickly accessible places, for further maintenance during operation.<p>
<p>The cost for heatpump installation also depends on the size of the system and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, including installation. Whole-house systems, on the other hand, range in price from $2,500 to $7,500, including installation. Geothermal heatpump generally require excavation to install, which adds several thousand dollars to the cost.<p>
