<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode".

This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
