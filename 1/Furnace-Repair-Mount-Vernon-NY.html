<h3>Things to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service at Mount Vernon NY</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, carried out a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by enhancing airflow.

In many cases, measured particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
