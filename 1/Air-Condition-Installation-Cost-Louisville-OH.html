<p>Instead of incorporating to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. A ductless unit has a built-in effectiveness benefit due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leaks in your ducts. Since they do not require any new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions. Since an unit is installed in each space or location you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that instantly raise the temperature level in the room when you exist.<p>

<p>Excellent Product! Shipment was type of unusual being that package was opened and items might have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The item was incredibly lite weight and requires time to apply. Note: purchase advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit.

<p>Fights the hot days: Though most temperature levels in Seattle are acceptably average, you can expect a minimum of thirty days throughout which temperature levels will reach above 80 degrees.

<p>The exhaust outlets enable all hazardous gases to escape your home so there's no dangerous accumulation of carbon monoxide and other such gases.

<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to protect the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, numerous studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. Nevertheless, select your contractor carefully, many of the 'respectable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales strategies that DO take advantage of uninformed property owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a credible company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is an odorless, colorless hazardous gas. Because it is impossible to see, smell or taste, CO can kill you before you understand it is in your house. At lower levels of direct exposure, CO triggers moderate results that are typically mistaken for the flu. These symptoms include headaches, dizziness, disorientation, nausea and fatigue. The impacts of CO exposure can vary greatly from individual to person depending on age, general health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>
