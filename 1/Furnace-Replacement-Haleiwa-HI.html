<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>A third way to choose whether your home may have poor indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, search for indications of problems with the ventilation in your home. Signs that can indicate your house may not have enough ventilation include wetness condensation on windows or walls, stuffy or stinky air, filthy central heating and air cooling equipment, and areas where books, shoes, or other products end up being moldy.

<p>In the case of heated water or steam, piping is used to carry the heat to the rooms.

The heat can be moved to the surrounding air using radiators, hot water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators might be installed on walls or set up within the floor to produce flooring heat.<p>
