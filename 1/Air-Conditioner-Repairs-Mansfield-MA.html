<h3>Recognizing the Importance of HVAC Systems in Mansfield MA</h3>
<p>After living in our house for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to change the cooling. I went ahead and purchased this Carrier and I must state it gets the job done rather well. It takes very little time to heat up or cool off your house which is one of the important things we didnâ $ t get from the one we had previously. The unit hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
