<p>All houses need effective ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has actually been burnt out from usage. Another possible reason could be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adjusting to the appropriate temperature level. Heaters that kick on regularly might be due to an unclean filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air appropriately.
