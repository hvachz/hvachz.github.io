<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. If your air conditioning system is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. Merely adding refrigerant is not a solution if it leaks. A skilled technician must fix any leak, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the appropriate quantity of refrigerant.

Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton.
