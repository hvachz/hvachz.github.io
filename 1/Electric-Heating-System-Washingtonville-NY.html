<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends on how well it collects contaminants from indoor air (revealed as a percentage efficiency rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (revealed in cubic feet per minute).

The long-lasting efficiency of any air cleaner depends upon preserving it according to the producer's directions.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a large central air conditioner unit that sits outside your home. Heat pumps operate on electrical energy and work like a/c in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>Because they eliminate moisture from the air, Air conditioners can produce a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have an usually plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Gradually, algae can obstruct this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work. In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the area.

<p>I am really impressed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call business several years ago and understand the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
