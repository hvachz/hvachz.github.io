The circuit boards control and collaborate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the brand-new control board must be set up exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t appropriately detected, changing a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable when installed. Itâ $ s smart to leave this repair to a professional to detect.<p>
