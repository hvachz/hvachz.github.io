<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical product over time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
