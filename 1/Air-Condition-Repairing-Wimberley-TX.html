<p>An indoor air pollutant is a compound in the air that might affect the health of people who live in the house. Contaminants might come from outside the house-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in a connected garage, yard trash burning, or radon entering your home from the ground below. An air pollutant could also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a faulty furnace, unstable organic compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, family cleaning, or individual care items. Germs and infections, animal dander, and pest parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
