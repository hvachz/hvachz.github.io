<h3>How to Choose An Expert HVAC Tech in Putnam CT</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was really clear and quick about his assessment, ensuring I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix utilized in vehicles in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this type of application, however is still imported and can be purchased and used by licensed HVAC technicians. For systems needing just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and carrying out far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "low-cost" by many people.<p>

<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces heated up by radiators are vulnerable to cold spots", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and very hot next to the radiators.
