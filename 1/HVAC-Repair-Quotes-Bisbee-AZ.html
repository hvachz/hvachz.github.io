<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as created. Wetness management and humidity control may conflict with efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For instance, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide make-up air at lower temperatures (style levels), instead of the higher temperatures often utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to supply thermal convenience inside your home.

<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, indicating they use air to exchange heat, in the same method as an automobile radiator or normal family ac system does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It gathers water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which needs to be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outside air.<p>
