<h3>Choosing the Right Maynardville TN Company For Heating Repair</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy performance. In many cases, determined particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Both must be kept tidy since an air conditioner moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately result in damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
