<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He understood simply what the problem was and repaired it very quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
