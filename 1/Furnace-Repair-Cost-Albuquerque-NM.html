<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
