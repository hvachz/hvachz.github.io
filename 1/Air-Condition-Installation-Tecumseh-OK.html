<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply 8 to ten years old, it could suck up to two times the electrical energy that even a low-end new one would use. That's because it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to supply a specific cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling expenses than equipment installed just a couple of years ago.<p>
<p>Just like a lot of home improvement jobs, the cost of a full central heater can vary extensively based upon the size of the home. Most heaters will last between 15 and 20 years. In selecting a furnace, homeowner ought to consider heat output and performance. Heat output is determined in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace must be matched to the size of the home. A small home, for instance, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the home too quickly and shut off for too long, leading to inconsistent temperature level levels.<p>
