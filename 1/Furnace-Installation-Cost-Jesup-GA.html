<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace specialists often discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Radiant heating uses a number of special benefits over forced air heating unit. For example, radiant heating systems are more energy effective than forced air systems. They do not need to stress over duct leaks, which are accountable for output losses of as much as 30% in other heater types. Transmitting heat through solid objects will likewise cause it to last longer than utilizing air as a thermal medium. A house heated up by a glowing system will warm up quicker, and stay warm with less energy spent. These are just a few of the many advantages that a radiant heat system can provide you.<p>

EPA studies of human exposure to air toxins indicate that indoor levels of pollutants may be two to five times-- and sometimes more than 100 times-- higher than outdoor levels.
