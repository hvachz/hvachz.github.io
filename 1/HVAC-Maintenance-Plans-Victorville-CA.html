<p>Central air units are measured in lots. This measurement is based upon the system's capability to cool your home. For example, a 1 load unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 load system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it means the quantity of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
