<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash being available in monthly, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to use auto debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There need to not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
