<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends on how well it collects toxins from indoor air (expressed as a portion performance rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering aspect (revealed in cubic feet per minute). A really effective collector with a low air-circulation rate will not work, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less effective collector. The long-term efficiency of any air cleaner depends on maintaining it according to the maker's instructions.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump appears like a big central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outdoors your home. Heat pumps operate on electrical power and work like a/c unit in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This enables them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a standard electric heating system (like a space heating system) with the same quantity of electricity. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
