<p>Sean was very handy. He is a really pleasant person to deal with. No pressure applied to purchase additional stuff. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no concerns besides the blower motor. The only reason he could not install the brand-new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
