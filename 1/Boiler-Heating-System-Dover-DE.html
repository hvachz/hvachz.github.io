Among the most typical areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a great chance; you may have a water leakage in the attic. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer.
