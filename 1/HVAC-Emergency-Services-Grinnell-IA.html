<p>Wow - just wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 guideline however got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
