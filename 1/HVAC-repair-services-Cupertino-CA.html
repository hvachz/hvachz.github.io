<h3>Hot Water Heating System in Cupertino California</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the see. They advised changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost but a fast internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was defective. No charge for the go to or the new part.

<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. Furthermore, the company utilized 98% of the existing product bought with your house. This company introduced a service arrangement contract to offer service to heating, electrical and plumbing. Throughout the assessment on an extremely cold day they killed the furnace claiming health threat factor and contractor laws for their choice. As a new resident I have actually found out how to determine the sincere HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
