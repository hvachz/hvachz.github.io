<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heating units are still commonly utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often described as just glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating components set up in the subfloor of each space in the house, periodically linked to terminal units like baseboard heating systems. When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the technique is described as radiant heat.<p>
