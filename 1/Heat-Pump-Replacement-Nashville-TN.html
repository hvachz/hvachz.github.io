They may recommend that you trim thick trees or bushes to ensure adequate air flow around the system.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money can be found in each month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to provide auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There need to not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
