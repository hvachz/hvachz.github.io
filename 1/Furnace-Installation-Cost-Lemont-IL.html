<p>Indoor impurities. These consist of chemicals used in the building and construction or restoration of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Incomplete combustion and poor ventilation of these devices (cook stoves, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor impurities. Gas cook tops ought to be used with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating appliances must be sealed and power-vented systems installed to eliminate items of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning ranges can also produce particulates and should be vented outside.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. At the same time, heat is taken in from inside and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>The primary health effect associated with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may posture threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your risk of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
