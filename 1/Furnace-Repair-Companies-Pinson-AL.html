<p>Specialist heating system installations. However, even the best-maintained heater will ultimately fail. HVAC specialists recommend following this basic rule when deciding whether it deserves buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost over half the rate of a new system, it's best to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have much more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than needed.<p>
<p>For instance, impurities might gather within the air diffusers and grills, introducing toxins into the environment. Or if the outside air intake lies near a source of wetness or other outside contaminant, it may serve as a pathway to bring the pollutants inside. Or the ventilation system might not be working as well as it should-- if debris is obstructing the outdoor air intake, for instance, or the filters are contaminated or badly maintained.<p>
