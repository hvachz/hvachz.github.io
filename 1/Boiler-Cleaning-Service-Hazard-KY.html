<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help determine the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The objective is to provide adequate changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this. A typical component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
