<p>Immediate results might appear after a single exposure or duplicated exposures. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and tiredness. Such instant results are treatable and normally short-term. Sometimes the treatment is just eliminating the person's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be determined. Symptoms of some diseases, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might also show up right after exposure to some indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Volatile natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals produced as gases from items or processes; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs inside consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively innocuous as a new carpet is likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might consist of volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within during water usage.<p>
<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of direct exposure is through the creation of an aerosol result, most frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from inadequately placed or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which may go into neighboring ventilation consumption. Break outs in medical centers and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outside fountains in public tourist attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water products is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to acquire infection.<p>
