<p>Check these three things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the registers in your house are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The reduced air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous registers were closed or the filter was clogged. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the issue.<p>
