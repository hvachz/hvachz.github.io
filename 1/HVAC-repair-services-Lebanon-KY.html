<p>Air contaminants can vary from impurities generated from the outdoors by your animals to dangerous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide gas is a common air contaminant arising from natural gas that leaves into your house without being burned off. Older houses may consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when released into the air. In kitchens and bathrooms, mold and mildew can become a nuisance where moisture levels are usually higher than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Second, identification of contaminant sources is typically essential to determining the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such details can often be gotten by asking for copies of air monitoring information from the employer. If keeping an eye on data is not available, yet a high number of health signs have actually been reported, the Union agent should request that the employer have air tracking tests carried out. Evaluation of this information may determine possibly hazardous sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. Nevertheless, when contaminant concentrations are extremely low, keeping track of information may not discuss the observed or reported health signs.<p>
