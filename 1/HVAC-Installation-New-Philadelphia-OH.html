<p>Excellent Product! Shipment was sort of strange being that the box was opened and items might have fell out. However after review of contents we assured it was all intact. The item was very lite weight and takes some time to apply. Keep in mind: buy advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we solved issues. I would advise this item to anybody who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the first time.

<p>Because they get rid of wetness from the air, Air conditioners can create a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have an usually plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Gradually, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work. In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the location. To handle condensate problems, please see Ac system Leaks Water, below.<p>
