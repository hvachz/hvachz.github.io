<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on.
