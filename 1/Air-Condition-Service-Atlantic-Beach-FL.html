<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
