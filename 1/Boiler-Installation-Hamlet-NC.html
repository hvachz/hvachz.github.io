<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance at Hamlet NC</h3>
<p>Another method to reducing the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your house is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming indoors. Most home heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home.

No additional charge.<p>

<p>An indoor air toxin is a substance in the air that may impact the health of individuals who reside in the home. Pollutants might come from outside the house-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in a connected garage, backyard trash burning, or radon getting in your house from the ground below.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness. The goal is to provide enough changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A common aspect required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
