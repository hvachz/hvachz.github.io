<h3>AC Compressor Repair in Huntington IN 46750</h3>
<p>AC systems and thermostats have integrated hold-up functions when they're shut down and after that repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've registered for an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've installed the parts revealed and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature below the indoor temperature level, and the system does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then measure the height and width of the opening. When shopping for an air conditioner to ensure it'll fit easily into the window, be sure to have those dimensions on hand.
