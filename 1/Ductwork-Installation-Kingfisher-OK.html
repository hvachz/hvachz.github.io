Modern 2- and three-stage heating systems increase efficiency even further by running at lower or greater capability depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>Air conditioning system producers usually make rugged, high quality products. If your a/c unit fails, start by inspecting any fuses or circuit breakers. Let the unit cool off for about 5 minutes before resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioning conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limitation switch may have tripped; reset it by pushing the button, situated in the compressor's access panel.<p>
