You can generally conclude that the capacitor has stopped working. Often you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pressing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille.

<p>Recent Review: They were great! Many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally requested. They fulfilled my needs totally by supplying a professional quote with choices, without pushing extra products. The crew showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and completed a little early. The also promptly followed up with the necessary inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, frequently described as central air" or split-system air conditioning", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the walls, ceilings, or floorings covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioner to the house. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it distributes through the home; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Find out how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
