<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Principles in Natick MA</h3>
<p>Your lungs are responsible for bringing fresh air into your body, while simultaneously getting rid of waste gases and particulates.

Poor air quality - whether it is inside or outdoors - can make it progressively hard for your lungs to function correctly, and can have negative health affects.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
