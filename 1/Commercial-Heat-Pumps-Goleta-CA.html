<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have been correctly dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you select them up. Try a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
