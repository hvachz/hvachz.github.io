<h3>The Advantages of Buying A New Furnace in Des Plaines IL</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were really happy that someone as knowledgeable as Adam was able to return and repair the air conditioner. We had actually bought the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any property buyers: hire Blue Flame to check the ac system prior to you buy. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam stated he had methods to evaluate AC units even in winter. We wish we had actually understood him then.<p>
<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding sounds. Though many air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units may be belt-driven. Squealing noises from a belt-drive air handler normally happen when the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips. In many cases, the belt is improperly lined up or used and requires replacement. Follow the instructions above under Air Conditioner Not Blowing Air and describe your owner's handbook.<p>
