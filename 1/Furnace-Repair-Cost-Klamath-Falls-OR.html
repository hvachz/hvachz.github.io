<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
