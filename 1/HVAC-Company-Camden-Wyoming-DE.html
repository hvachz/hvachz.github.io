<p>Your Evaluation This is my 3rd time utilizing All the time. Ilan always makes himself readily available - whether it's a heating issue in the middle of the night in the depth of winter season to more regular calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is knowledgeable with these gadgets).

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to briefly switch back into the routine cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
