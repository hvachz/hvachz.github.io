<p>Your ventilation, air, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a variety of pollutants that have the possible to negatively affect your health-- impurities such as mold, fungi, bacteria, and very small particles of dust.

For example, he might seal spaces and cracks in the external walls and attic flooring, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling costs. Insulation might be a more reliable solution to your cooling issues than replacing your equipment.<p>

This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product in time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
