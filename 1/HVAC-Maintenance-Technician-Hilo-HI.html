<p>The first a/c and refrigerators used harmful or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might lead to fatal accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion house and building convenience cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
