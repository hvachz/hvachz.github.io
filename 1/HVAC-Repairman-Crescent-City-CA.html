<p>For every single load of laundry you dry, that wetness has to go someplace. If your clothes dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just asking for mold buildup, says Dr. Khatri. Mentioning laundry, changing from fragranced to fragrance-free items can be a efficient and simple approach to lower ambient air pollution and prospective health risks, according to a 2018 research study in the journal Air Quality, Environment & Health.<p>
<p>A 3rd way to decide whether your house might have poor indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, look for indications of issues with the ventilation in your home. Indications that can indicate your home might not have sufficient ventilation include moisture condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or foul-smelling air, filthy central heating and air cooling devices, and areas where books, shoes, or other products end up being moldy. To detect smells in your home, step outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering your house, note whether smells are noticeable.<p>
