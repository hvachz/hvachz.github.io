<p>A packaged system, usually installed on the roof, is most typically used on commercial structures, but it is likewise an alternative for property owners to think about. Often times, these systems consist of not only the air conditioning system itself however likewise a furnace. An advantage of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those seeking to conserve money on the installation of a new heating & cooling system individually, because the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are normally just offered for larger homes due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be a good way to save cash on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more costly than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best choice for house owners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>
