<p>G&S did an excellent task installing our new furnace and AC system. The best aspect of G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their warranty. Also they diagnosed the problem and fixed very quickly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>My oldest kid always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a brand-new one. For some time I dismissed him however then I realized that it actually didnâ $ t distribute air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really consider anything else other than changing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The noise level is low and itâ $ s great on energy saving too.<p>
<p>A packaged system, typically installed on the roofing, is most typically used on commercial buildings, but it is likewise an alternative for house owners to think about. Oftentimes, these systems include not only the air conditioning system itself however likewise a furnace. A benefit of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those looking to conserve money on the installation of a new heating and cooling system separately, given that the system is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are normally only offered for bigger homes due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a good way to save cash on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more expensive than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best choice for property owners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
