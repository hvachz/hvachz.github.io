<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
