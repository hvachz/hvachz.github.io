<h2>How To Hire Emergency HVAC Contractors in North East</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Right now, countless dust mites, dead skin cells, building debris, and mold may be living in your house's duct, impacting the air you breathe along with the efficiency of your heating and air conditioning system. Indoor air quality isn't on many people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a danger to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a recent survey by the Customer Reports National Proving Ground. But many of the things people do-- or do not do-- can contribute to the stew of air-borne pollutants in their houses and get worse asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>The first air conditioners and fridges utilized flammable or poisonous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might lead to deadly mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion house and building comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
