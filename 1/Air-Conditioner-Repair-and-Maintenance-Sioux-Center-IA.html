<p>For each load of laundry you dry, that moisture needs to go someplace. If your clothes dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply requesting for mold buildup, says Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, changing from fragranced to fragrance-free items can be a reliable and simple technique to minimize ambient air contamination and possible health threats, according to a 2018 research study in the journal Air Quality, Environment & Health.<p>
<p>I am really satisfied with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service several years ago and understand the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
