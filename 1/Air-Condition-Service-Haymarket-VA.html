<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Companies in Haymarket</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Proper ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and sometimes these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the exact same toxins. In other words, often the air inside can be more hazardous than the air outside.<p>

Preventive cooling maintenance and heating maintenance service have many benefits for your HVAC system, like improved energy performance.

<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to change your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as essential as a regular oil change in your car. A dirty filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, clean filter better traps impurities and debris in the air. Energy Star recommends replacing your filter when every 3 months. Throughout high usage months, examine the filters at least regular monthly.<p>

<h3>Tips to Help You Hire Haymarket VA Professionals for Air Conditioning Repair</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, conducted a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by improving airflow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, measured particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Stopped up gutters can result in water seeping into the house, resulting in mold development, according to the EPA. Yes, mold can grow virtually anywhere if the conditions are right, including on top of your house. Exposure to high levels of family mold may activate mold allergic reaction signs. Next time it rains, check your rain gutters. If you see water dripping out of end caps, streaming on the outside, or dripping behind them, it's time to go out the ladder.<p>
