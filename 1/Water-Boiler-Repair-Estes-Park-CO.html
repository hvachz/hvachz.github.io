<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time.
