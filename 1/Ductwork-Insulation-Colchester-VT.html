Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
