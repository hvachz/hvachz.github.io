As a result your oil or gas furnace might run longer to offer the very same quantity of heat. This will trigger your energy costs to increase. And, all of the cash you pay your energy utility companies each month could be utilized to help you spend for a new, much more energy-efficient and energy conserving furnace. Start to compare the cost of your current heating expenses with heating costs from the previous years. If there is a considerable difference, then it's time to change your furnace.<p>

The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs.

Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
