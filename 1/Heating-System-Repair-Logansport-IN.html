Technicians are often needed to operate in confined locations, on high ladders near ceilings, or on the roofing systems of houses. They can be exposed to undesirable weather for long periods of time. Because they are called to structures without functioning climate control, they are likewise subject to the severe hot or cold temperature levels existing inside a location.<p>
<p>Both the evaporator and the condenser are sealed. Therefore, a professional service person should be called for nearly any maintenance besides regular cleaning. Central air conditioners should be professionally checked and changed prior to the start of every cooling season. However, don't let your maintenance end with this annual examination. While there aren't lots of repairs you can make yourself, there are specific maintenance treatments you can follow to keep your system operating at peak performance.<p>
