<p>Similar to most home improvement projects, the cost of a complete central heating unit can differ widely based on the size of the house. The majority of heaters will last in between 15 and 20 years. In picking a furnace, property owners need to consider heat output and effectiveness. Heat output is determined in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace ought to be matched to the size of the home. A little house, for instance, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the house too quickly and shut off for too long, resulting in inconsistent temperature level levels.<p>
