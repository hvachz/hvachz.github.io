<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
