<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not offer car debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money coming in each month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to offer car debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There need to not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
