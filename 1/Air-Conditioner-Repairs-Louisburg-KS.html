<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning system works but your home doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
