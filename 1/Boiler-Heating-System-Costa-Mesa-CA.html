<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide ought to be adjusted frequently, and outdoor measurements utilized for calculations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors might likewise be necessary.<p>
<p>Next, and possibly simply as crucial when it comes to central air costs, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too large will have a simple time keeping the house cool, however will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air.

Considering bigger systems cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC system your central air system requires to hold.<p>

The heat exchanger permits air to be warmed without being available in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct, supplying warm air to individual bedrooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or signs up.<p>
