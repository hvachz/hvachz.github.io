<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as developed. Moisture management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide make-up air at lower temperature levels (design levels), instead of the greater temperatures sometimes used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for most of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, throughout most of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require additional cooling to offer thermal convenience inside your home. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors creates the need for careful attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities generate mold development and wetness indoors is associated with a higher occurrence of occupant respiratory problems.<p>
<p>It is not suggested that "regular" occupational direct exposure limitations (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be used to determine if the general indoor air quality meets a particular standard. Occupational direct exposure limits noted in health and wellness policies and the Threshold Limit Worths ® (TLVs) recommended by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) are meant as a guide to prevent disease or particular effects (like eye and nose irritation) in industrial circumstances. These limits may not be suitable in office settings or for the home.<p>
