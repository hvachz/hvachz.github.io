The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the automobile debit, although my company does not offer auto debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash coming in every month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to offer vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
