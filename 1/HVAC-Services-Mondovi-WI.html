CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that allows the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system components, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in big residential, office, and school buildings.<p>

<p>You're probably hearing the fan motor trying to begin without the increase it needs from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz. You can often conclude that the capacitor has failed. In some cases you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. But the chances are excellent that this might work for one cycle, however the capacitor will stop working next time the AC goes on. It's best to replace the capacitor.<p>

<h3>The Operation of the Boiler Burner at Mondovi WI</h3>
<p>The icing problem becomes much more extreme with lower outdoor temperature levels, so heatpump are commonly set up in tandem with a more standard kind of heating, such as an electrical heater, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used instead of the heatpump during harsher winter temperatures. In this case, the heatpump is utilized effectively during the milder temperature levels, and the system is switched to the standard heat source when the outdoor temperature level is lower.<p>

<p>Indoor environments are extremely complicated and building occupants may be exposed to a variety of contaminants (in the form of gases and particles) from office machines, cleaning products, building and construction furnishings, activities and carpets, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure materials, microbial development (fungal, mold, and bacterial), insects, and outside toxins. Other aspects such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can likewise affect how people respond to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in enough outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
