<p>Energy effectiveness can be improved a lot more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This allows a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heating systems. Zones are managed by numerous thermostats. In water heating systems the thermostats control zone valves, and in forced air systems they control zone dampers inside the vents which selectively obstruct the flow of air. In this case, the control system is really vital to keeping an appropriate temperature level.<p>
<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
