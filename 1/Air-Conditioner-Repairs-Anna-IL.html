<p>Asthmatic kids are particularly at danger. EPA estimates that exposure to previously owned smoke increases the number of episodes and severity of signs in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic kids, and may cause countless nonasth-matic children to develop the disease each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition made worse by direct exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Exposure to previously owned smoke causes eye, throat, and nose irritation. It might impact the cardiovascular system and some research studies have actually connected exposure to pre-owned smoke with the beginning of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Details Clearinghouse (IAQ INFO), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. At the same time, heat is soaked up from indoors and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you must examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
