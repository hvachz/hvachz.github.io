<p>Your ventilation, heating, and air conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a range of pollutants that have the potential to negatively affect your health-- impurities such as mold, fungi, germs, and very small particles of dust.

For instance, he might seal spaces and cracks in the external walls and attic flooring, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating costs. Insulation may be a more effective solution to your cooling issues than replacing your equipment.<p>
