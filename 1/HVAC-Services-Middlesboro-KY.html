Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was absolutely glad to have a heated house once again. What's most incredible was that this all happened during Thanksgiving week!

Moreover, the tangible results of a PM is often difficult to measure, as one response stated the savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. A lot of pieces of a furnace or a/c do not just break at the snap of a finger, but instead is the result of repeated use of a part that runs out balance.
