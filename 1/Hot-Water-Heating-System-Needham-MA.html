<p>A third method to decide whether your house might have bad indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air contamination. Finally, look for indications of issues with the ventilation in your home. Indications that can suggest your house may not have adequate ventilation include moisture condensation on walls or windows, foul-smelling or stuffy air, filthy central heating and air cooling equipment, and areas where books, shoes, or other items end up being musty. To identify odors in your home, step outside for a few minutes, and after that upon reentering your home, note whether odors are visible.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an important role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of procedures which results in the supply and elimination of air from inside a structure." Those procedures include generating outdoors air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the structure, and moving some part of indoor air outside. The quality of indoor air will be impacted if one or more of these processes are underperforming.<p>
