<h3>Factors to Consider When Looking for a Fantastic AC Repair Company in Wellsburg WV</h3>
<p>Sean was very handy. He is a really pleasant individual to work with. No pressure used to purchase additional stuff. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no issues aside from the blower motor. The only factor he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He understood simply what the issue was and fixed it extremely rapidly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
