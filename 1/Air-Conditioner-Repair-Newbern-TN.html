<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by building, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in buildings by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination.

Micro-organisms or germs might also exist within the ventilation system. They might spread throughout the whole work environment or structure by ways of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>
