<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wood floor joist system, beneath the wooded subsurface and last flooring surface. This is generally utilized in a 2nd or third-floor  area and benefits from the flooring joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and additional density of an in-screed concrete put.
