<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the go to. They recommended replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't cheap however a fast web search validated WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was extremely delighted they waited their work and repaired the problem. Will definitely be using them once again.<p>

<p>Ignitor and Flame Sensing Units: â $ " Â When your HSI (hot surface ignitor) or electronic lighter spoils, the furnace canâ $ t fire, and it shuts down quickly.
