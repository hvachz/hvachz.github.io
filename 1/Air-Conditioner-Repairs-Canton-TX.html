Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has enjoyed the single-family house installation company totally flip on its head the last few years. Winter season used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times swelling to as much as 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and individuals." And not simply with beginners more accustomed to AC living.
