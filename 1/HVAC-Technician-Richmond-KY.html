<p>The primary problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, employees try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system produces more problems, considering that a few of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the cooling individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor units operate separately from each other.<p>
