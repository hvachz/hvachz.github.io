<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act much like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. If your home or building has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most economical. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to install an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>This is especially noteworthy, as gas ranges can trigger levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with poorly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
