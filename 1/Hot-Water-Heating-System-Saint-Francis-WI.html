<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the exact same. As soon as the wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly cure and harden-- normally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom floor.<p>
