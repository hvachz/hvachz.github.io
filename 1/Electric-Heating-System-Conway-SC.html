<p>Usually, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. If your AC unit is wintry, the evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. Likewise, if the air conditioning unit smells bad, there could be bacteria buildup on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil takes in the heat away from your house. It will take from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to change the a/c's evaporator coil.<p>
<p>Some health effects might show up soon after a single direct exposure or repeated exposures to a toxin. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such immediate results are treatable and typically short-term. In some cases the treatment is simply eliminating the individual's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be determined.

<p>In addition, house owners have a range of options to choose from in powering a flooring heating system. Radiant systems are compatible with electrical, gas, even geothermal and solar energy sources.

<p>Mobile houses are typically smaller sized than stick-built residential or commercial properties and use substantially less oil and a much smaller sized furnace to heat. Expect the average mobile house oil furnace to have starting expenses of around $1,500. Keep in mind that not as numerous brand names produce oil heaters for this usage, and you might discover more options with natural gas, lp, or electric heaters.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless harmful gas. Since it is difficult to see, taste or smell, CO can eliminate you before you are aware it is in your home. At lower levels of direct exposure, CO causes mild effects that are often mistaken for the influenza. These symptoms consist of headaches, dizziness, disorientation, queasiness and fatigue. The results of CO exposure can vary significantly from individual to individual depending upon age, general health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>
