<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network access, or why that gain access to would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity expert at a big seller who asked not to be called since he did not have authorization to speak on the record, it prevails for large retail operations to have a team that routinely monitors energy consumption and temperature levels in shops to save money on costs (especially at night) and to alert shop managers if temperatures in the stores vary outside of an appropriate range that might avoid customers from shopping at the store.<p>
