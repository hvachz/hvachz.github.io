<h3>The Fundamentals of Central Heating and Air Conditioning in Towson MD</h3>
<p>There are lots of reasons that this can take place. The bright side is that you can address a number of these aspects by yourself without the need to call for professional help. Start by opening the heat registers and after that carry on to examining the thermostat settings. Next, check the furnace power, reset the furnace or inspect the service door cover. You can also check the filter to make sure it is clear of dirt and inspect the standing pilot burner to ensure it is lit.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
