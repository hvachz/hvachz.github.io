<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in loads. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it indicates the quantity of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>They were terrific! A lot of HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to offer you with the service originally requested. They fulfilled my requirements completely by offering an expert quote with alternatives, without pressing additional products. The crew appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also quickly followed up with the necessary inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely suggest this company.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by building, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures through natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>

Normally, an HVAC system costs $4,820 to $9,350 to set up a 5-ton unit for a 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot home.<p>
