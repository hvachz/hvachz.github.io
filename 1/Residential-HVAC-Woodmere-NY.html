<p>The quality of the air inside our houses, schools and offices matters, particularly considering that we invest most of our lives inside. Air conditioning unit help to dehumidify the incoming air, however in incredibly humid environments or in cases where the a/c is extra-large, it might not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the air conditioning unit will require more energy to cool your house. A preferable option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. A ductless system has a built-in efficiency benefit since up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leaks in your ducts. Ductless heatpump are fantastic for additions since they don't need any new ductwork to be set up. Because an unit is installed in each room or location you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature level in the room when you exist.<p>

<p>Forced air systems are the most common heater types on the market, but they're not always the very best choice for every house.

<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our new furnace and AC unit. The very best thing about G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Producers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Also they identified the issue and fixed really rapidly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
