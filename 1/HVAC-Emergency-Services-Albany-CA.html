<h2>How To Hire Residential HVAC Service in Albany</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heating units are still extensively used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too rapidly, and your home will not heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A dirty filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
