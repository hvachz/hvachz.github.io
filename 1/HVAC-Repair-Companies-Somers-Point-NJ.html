<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your house's square video.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must momentarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
