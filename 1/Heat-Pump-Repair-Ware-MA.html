<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy.

The outside condenser system also changes functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
