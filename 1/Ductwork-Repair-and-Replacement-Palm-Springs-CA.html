<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you need to examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
