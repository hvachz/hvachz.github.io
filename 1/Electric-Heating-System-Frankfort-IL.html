This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>It is especially essential to take as many of these steps as possible while you are involved in short-term activities that can produce high levels of pollutants-for example, painting, paint stripping, heating with kerosene heating units, cooking, or engaging in maintenance and hobby activities such as welding, soldering, or sanding. You may also pick to do a few of these activities outdoors, if you can and if weather licenses.<p>
