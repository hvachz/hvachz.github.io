And, if you have actually signed up for an energy-saving device from your local power energy, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts shown and re-installed the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature level, and the unit doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>They were terrific! Many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to supply you with the service initially asked for.
