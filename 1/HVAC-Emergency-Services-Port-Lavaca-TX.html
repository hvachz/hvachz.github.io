<p>There are lots of actions a property owner can require to choose products that will avoid indoor air issues from occurring - a couple of them are mentioned here. Initially, use exterior-grade pressed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, cabinetry, and wall surface areas. Or, as an option, consider using strong wood items. Secondly, if you plan to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, particularly concrete in basements, ensure that an efficient moisture barrier is set up prior to installing the carpet. If it ends up being damp, do not completely adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be removed.<p>

But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
