<p>Power Vac America offers commercial, industrial, institutional, marine and residential duct cleaning and HVAC system cleaning company. On Long Island where we lie, as anywhere else, there are reliable contractors and those who are less trusted. With more than 1500 HVAC contractors in our market, around only 10% are certified to provide energy star refunds on brand-new devices. Service contract customers must get higher concern when a service call is needed. Long term companies with verified credentials through dept of customer affairs and bbb, offer reassurance to the homeowner. It is necessary to research study and deal with quality companies. When you have several service headaches, price means a lot less.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a big central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outdoors your house. Heatpump work on electricity and work like a/c in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This enables them to produce two to three times as much heat as a basic electric heater (like a space heater) with the exact same quantity of electricity. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
