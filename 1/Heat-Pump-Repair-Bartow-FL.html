<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most typical cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your home won't warm up.

A dirty filter likewise triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<h3>Turning to the Right Company for the Right Furnace Repair in Bartow FL</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>

<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air issues by including new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes produce contaminants.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outside air penetrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
