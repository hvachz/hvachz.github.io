I now work as a consultant to verify the so called solutions and problems. 9 out of 10, I check are entirely wrong.<p>
<p>To be truthful, few of the facilities supervisors who utilize our indoor air quality tracking service came to us because of that. Most of the time they were initially interested in remotely monitoring some other element of their buildings, such as energy usage, in an effort to cut expenses. It wasn't up until later on, as they continued dealing with us, that they learned about and executed indoor air quality monitoring to provide a healthier, safer building environment-- and to avoid the unfavorable effects connected with indoor air pollutants.<p>
