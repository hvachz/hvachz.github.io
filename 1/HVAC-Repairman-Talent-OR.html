<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the cost fantastic but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<h3>Residential and Commercial HVAC Services in Talent OR</h3>
<p>Due to the fact that things ran efficiently without any sound, I was really delighted in the start. Moreover, I saw visible modifications in my electrical power costs. After two years, things began to change. There have been awkward noises. I got it checked and repaired. I am hoping that is the end of the issue. In general, it has been an excellent experience. Reputable on the whole. Neat operation and excellent cooling system. Yes, I was not happy with its looks in the beginning. However then recognized Air conditionings are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them.. Second of all like extended automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the needed skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat consumers relatively. As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be totally made the most of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to appropriately service and the unit has been running issue complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
