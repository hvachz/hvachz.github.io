<p>I have been using Waychoff for about ten years. Initially, they repaired a bad installation from a previous company. Thereafter, they have maintained my system semi-annually. Their techs are really experienced and expert. Costs are reasonable. Constantly on time, and call when they are on their method. Waychoff set up a brand-new air handler and condenser this week. Due to the fact that the cost was undoubtedly sensible, I did not trouble to get competitor's quotes due to the fact that of my trust in Waychoff.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to safeguard your investment by just using the services of a licensed contractor or a certified agent from a business or retailer to do the installation. If you choose to try to do it yourself, or hire a non-licensed person to do the work, in many, if not all cases, you will void the guarantee for the a/c system. A voided guarantee won't do you any great ought to the system fail or breakdown. Do it right from the get-go and work with a certified individual with the experience to set up the system.<p>
