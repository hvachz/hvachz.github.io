<h3>Getting Throughout Central Heating Installation in Stafford TX</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. Two on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to eliminate the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heating system. We decided on getting something more pricey than a conventional water heater as gas is one of our greatest energy expenses. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the primary panel.

You must hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
