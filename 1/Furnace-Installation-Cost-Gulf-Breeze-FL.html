<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either because of noticeable growth or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and inspect. Leaky return ducts can likewise present moisture. Again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>There is a required balance in making your decision though as systems with greater AFUE rankings frequently include greater price tags.

<p>A customized air conditioning system that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic a/c unit because both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the very same air path.

Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the room is in fact warmed, simply as by an electric heater that draws the exact same quantity of power.<p>
