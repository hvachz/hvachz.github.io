<h3>Ductless Heating And Cooling in Peachtree Corners Georgia</h3>

Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and check. Dripping return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Again, if you believe a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
