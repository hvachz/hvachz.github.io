<p>This is particularly noteworthy, as gas stoves can cause levels of pollution that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with improperly adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps simply as crucial when it pertains to central air conditioning costs, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too large will have an easy time keeping the home cool, however will have a harder time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not be able to correctly cool the home on hot days. Thinking about larger systems cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you may select to replace the outdoor compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency system. Consult a local heating and cooling contractor to ensure that the new compressor is properly matched to the indoor unit if you do so. Nevertheless, thinking about current modifications in refrigerants and cooling designs, it may be better to change the entire system.<p>
