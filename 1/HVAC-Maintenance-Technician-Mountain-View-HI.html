Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the unit sits. I seem like they give me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that comfort.<p>

Bought a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended warranties or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>
