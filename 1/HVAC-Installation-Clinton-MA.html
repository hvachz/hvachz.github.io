<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets ask for assessment and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. The probability of immediate reactions to indoor air toxins depends upon several factors consisting of age and preexisting medical conditions.

Some individuals can end up being sensitized to chemical or biological pollutants after duplicated or high level direct exposures.<p>

Required air systems will require a water-to-air heatpump while hydronic radiant heat systems will need water-to-water heat pumps. The size of geothermal heat pump and the size of ground loop needed depends upon the heating & cooling requirements for your house and is crucial iin ensuring the effectiveness and efficiency of the system. Capacity for geothermal systems is measured in loads. Typically, a 3-ton setup should be adequate for the typical house, but home size, heating and cooling needs, local geology and soil, and land schedule are all elements which will affect the proper size for your specific house.

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer season air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
