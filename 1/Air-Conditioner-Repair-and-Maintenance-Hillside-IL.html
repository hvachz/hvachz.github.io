<h3>Air Conditioner Reviews in Hillside IL 60162</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise changes roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>EER means Energy Performance Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning units is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>
