<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have problems, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Bought a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
