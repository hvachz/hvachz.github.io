<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile tube) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>

<p>I am really amazed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company many years earlier and know the value of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
