<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either because of visible growth or a moldy odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and check. Dripping return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you presume a mold issue, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
