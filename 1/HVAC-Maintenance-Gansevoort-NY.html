The task of an HVAC technician is fairly complex and can differ significantly from one office or home to the next. Every maintenance task and repair is different from the last. Every maintenance job may need totally different actions and procedures than the previous, depending upon the age and condition of the system being examined. Installations can also vary substantially, depending upon the age of the structure and how well the existing system was set up. In some cases, entirely new ductwork may need to be set up in a structure that had none prior to.<p>
<p>The first air conditioning system and fridges employed combustible or harmful gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that might result in deadly mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion house and building convenience cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>As a number of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant devices maker's to ensure your factory service warranties remain in location. Additionally, the concrete outcomes of a PM is frequently tough to quantify, as one response stated the cost savings in performance or repairs that were avoided. Many pieces of a furnace or air conditioner don't simply break at the snap of a finger, but rather is the outcome of recurring use of a part that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might stop working prematurely because the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature deterioration, causing holes and cracks. If that client had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and protects the component.  a really beneficial result and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
