<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs silently and effectively, but to have two major parts stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the billing before work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<h3>Residential and Commercial HVAC Services at Mc Kenzie TN</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went terrific. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heater. We decided on getting something more expensive than a traditional water heater as gas is among our greatest utility costs. We feel that this brand-new system will last a very long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
