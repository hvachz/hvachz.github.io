<p>I am an investor, I need to change 2 heating systems in a 8000square foot home. Some sources, such as constructing materials, home furnishings and products like air fresheners, can release pollutants basically continuously. Other sources, associated to activities like cigarette smoking, cleaning, redecorating or doing hobblies launch pollutants periodically. Malfunctioning or unvented devices or incorrectly used items can release greater and often dangerous levels of pollutants indoors.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Add To Air Quality Problems. HVAC systems can also exacerbate indoor air quality problems. The HVAC system might be contaminated (because of mold in duct lining or germs on coil or filters, for example), and the system might spread out these toxins throughout the home. Second, the HVAC duct circulation system can spread pollutants from one portion of the house to another. Regular maintenance and duct sealing can help lessen these issues.<p>

<p>New air conditioners typically range from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A higher SEER score means greater energy efficiency and potentially lower energy costs. A great SEER ranking for you depends on your house size, where you live and other elements.

It's not always about selecting the design with the highest SEER ranking, it's discovering the one that's right for you. This is where your dealer can help.<p>
<p>Old lead-based paint is the most considerable source of lead direct exposure in the U.S. today. Harmful exposures to lead can be created when lead-based paint is incorrectly eliminated from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of air-borne lead particles in homes can likewise arise from lead dust from outside sources, consisting of contaminated soil tracked within, and usage of lead in certain indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
