<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day.

I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
