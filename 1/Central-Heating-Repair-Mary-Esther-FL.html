<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to briefly change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
