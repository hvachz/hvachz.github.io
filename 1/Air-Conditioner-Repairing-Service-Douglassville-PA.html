<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
