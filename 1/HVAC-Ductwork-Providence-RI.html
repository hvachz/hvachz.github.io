If your house already has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably uncomplicated procedure. Installing a new gas furnace system can be rather expensive if you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>

Leaky return ducts can likewise present wetness. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
