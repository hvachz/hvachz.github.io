<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality in East Hanover NJ</h3>
<p>Your lungs are responsible for bringing fresh air into your body, while concurrently removing waste gases and particulates. Needless to say, the more particles that are in the air you breathe, the more difficult it is for your lungs to remove them. Poor air quality - whether it is inside your home or outdoors - can make it increasingly challenging for your lungs to operate appropriately, and can have unfavorable health impacts.<p>
<p>Oil heaters tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which needs to be properly vented and cleaned from the furnace routinely. Change the filters occasionally and have your ductwork cleaned due to the fact that the soot develops inside the ducts, reducing their efficiency over time. Expect to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, alter your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running efficiently.<p>
