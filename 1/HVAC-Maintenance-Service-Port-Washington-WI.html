Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single visit, or you can register for a maintenance strategy with your local heating and cooling company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get a couple of maintenance sees per year, plus another service call, a discount rate on parts, and usually some other perks.
