<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
