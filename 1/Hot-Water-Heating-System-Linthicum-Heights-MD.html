<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets requests for assessment and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure.

Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
