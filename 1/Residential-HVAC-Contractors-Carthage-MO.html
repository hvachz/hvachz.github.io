<p>Called WSE for a routine evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the check out. They advised changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost but a quick web search verified WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was defective. No charge for the go to or the new part.

<p>If the condenser coils are clogged, the compressor can overheat and shut down. You'll experience periodic durations of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are clean, clean them once again. Turn off the power. Flip the cooling service and furnace breaker in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, switch off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the detach block (Picture 1) and clean the condenser coils (Picture 2).
