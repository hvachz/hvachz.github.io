<p>An indoor air pollutant is a compound in the air that might impact the health of people who live in the home. Pollutants could originate from outside the home-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in an attached garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon going into your home from the ground listed below. An air pollutant might likewise come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a malfunctioning furnace, unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted space, previously owned smoke, mold growing on moist or damp carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or personal care items.
