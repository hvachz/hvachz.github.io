<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should temporarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
