<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets requests for consultation and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. The probability of immediate reactions to indoor air contaminants depends on numerous aspects consisting of age and preexisting medical conditions. In many cases, whether an individual reacts to a toxin depends on individual level of sensitivity, which varies enormously from individual to individual. Some individuals can become sensitized to biological or chemical toxins after repeated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. A ductless unit has a built-in performance advantage due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leaks in your ducts. Because they do not require any new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are great for additions. Because an unit is installed in each space or area you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that immediately raise the temperature level in the space when you exist.<p>
