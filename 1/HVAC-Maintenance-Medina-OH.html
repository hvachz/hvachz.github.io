<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on.

Prior to that occurs, you wish to get those capacitors altered to avoid additional damage to your system.<p>
<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not provide off heat effectively and will keep the system running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have bonded together-- something that can occur with time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts.
