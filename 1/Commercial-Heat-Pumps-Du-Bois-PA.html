<p>Since it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to run. Because it simply takes more electrical energy to run a larger unit, a large-scale compressor also costs more to run. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity successfully. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a chance to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed wetness. The result is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In reality, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>
