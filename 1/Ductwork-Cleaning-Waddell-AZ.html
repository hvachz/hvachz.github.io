"Humidifier fever" is a common disease triggered by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs.

If several registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the minimized air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home.
