The standards do not need you to change your existing central air conditioning units, and replacement parts and services need to still be offered for your home's systems.

The greater the system's SEER rating, the more energy effective it is. 1 An unit's SEER score can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all home appliances.<p>

These systems can obtain a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heatpump can just obtain an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Similar to other kinds of heatpump, ground source heatpump have their geothermal effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (COP). POLICE rates how much heat a system gets rid of or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to produce the heating or cooling result.

<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is usually a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
