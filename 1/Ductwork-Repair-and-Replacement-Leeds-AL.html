Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right now, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio where the system sits. I feel like they provide me favoritism, and want to pay a little bit more for that comfort.<p>
