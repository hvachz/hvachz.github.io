<p>I'll start with a gas furnace because it's the most typical heating system in Seattle homes. Warm air is provided to the spaces of your house through ducts, and cool air is collected through cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for effectiveness. Older systems from the 1970s may be rated 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is lost during the combustion process. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably uncomplicated process. If you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting, installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather expensive.<p>
