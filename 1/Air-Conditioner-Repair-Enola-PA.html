<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>These men have actually been terrific. At a realtor, I often need contractors to provide me an opinion for what deal with a house may cost. Just recently I required to call on these men two times.

Integrity isn't just their name, it's an organisation design they take seriously. You men are formally on speed dial. Speak with you quickly.<p>

Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have welded together-- something that can take place with time since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to do the trick up until you purchase a replacement-- which you must do quickly.<p>
