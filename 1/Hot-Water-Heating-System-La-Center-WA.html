<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, class or laboratory environments, rather than commercial or outdoor settings. For example, promoting maintenance services to existing consumers during the sluggish season can help alleviate the peak season pressure on your tech crew, as noted in Air Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration (ACHR) News Professionals can primarily concentrate on responding to calls from new clients, while your developed consumers stay happy as their HVAC systems hum along nicely thanks to proactive examinations.
