<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the a/c unit back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packing material to secure it from damage.

And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, place two 2x4s below the box to raise it up and safeguard it from wetness.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the price terrific however Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
