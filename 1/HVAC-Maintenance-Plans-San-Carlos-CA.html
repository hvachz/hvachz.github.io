<p>Your questions or issues about indoor air problems can often be answered by the government agencies in your state or local government. Duties for indoor air quality issues are usually divided amongst various companies. Calling or composing the agencies accountable for health or air quality assurance is the very best method to begin getting details from your state or local government. To acquire state agency contacts, call or compose EPA's IAQ Info Clearinghouse, (800) 438-4318, (703) 356-4020 in the Washington, D.C. location.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. With time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that takes place, you wish to get those capacitors changed to prevent further damage to your system.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
