<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise given that 1978. The selection of indoor units has one restriction: their overall power ought to not exceed the capability of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is extremely typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor units greater than the outdoor capacity by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to anticipate much better performance when all indoor systems are turned on at the same time, since the total capacity of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outside system. Basically, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that some of the rooms might not have a really comfy temperature level.

<p>As you normally need to use a self-leveling compound on top of the electric underfloor heating system, you need to consider the time it takes for this to entirely dry prior to the floor covering can be put in place - this is typically a day or more.
