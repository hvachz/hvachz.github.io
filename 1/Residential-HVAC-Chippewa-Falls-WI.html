<p>The icing problem ends up being a lot more severe with lower outside temperatures, so heat pumps are commonly installed in tandem with a more traditional type of heating, such as an electrical heating system, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used instead of the heatpump during harsher winter season temperature levels. In this case, the heat pump is used effectively during the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the traditional heat source when the outside temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>The time constantly comes to have your heating system changed; often it is a full 20 years after the initial installation and often it's sooner, but it constantly takes place.
