Sources of formaldehyde in the home include structure materials, smoking cigarettes, household products, and using unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene space heating systems.

<p>Rather of incorporating to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. Because as much as 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless unit has a built-in performance advantage. Because they do not need any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions. Since an unit is set up in each room or location you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure carbon dioxide must be calibrated often, and outside measurements utilized for estimations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be needed.<p>
