<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>

<p>My oldest boy always complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him however then I understood that it really didnâ $ t disperse air like it did in the past.

The sound level is low and itâ $ s great on energy saving too.<p>
