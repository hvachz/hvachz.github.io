<h3>Designing Tips for Central Heating Systems at Muscatine IA</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to remove the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heating system. We decided on getting something more pricey than a conventional water heater as gas is one of our most significant energy costs. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
