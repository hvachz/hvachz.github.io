<p>We're Not Simply Another Air Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Building-Related Disease (BRI) refers to less frequent (but often more serious) cases of people becoming ill after remaining in a specific structure at a particular time.

Legionnaires Illness is an example of BRI brought on by bacteria which can contaminate a building's a/c system.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outside system as close to the house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
<h3>HVAC Repair in Saint Matthews South Carolina</h3>
<p>If your air conditioning system is more than eight years of ages, repair is probably not worth the expenditure, unless it's a simple problem like particles blocking the condenser system or a worn fan belt. Still, to best weigh your repair-or-replace choice, ask your contractor to evaluate not just the condition of your existing devices, but also the ducts that deliver the cool air and the overall quality of the insulation in your home. Improving those components may increase the effectiveness of the system as much or more than installing new equipment.<p>

<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Problems in Saint Matthews SC</h3>
<p>A split cooling system may cost near that of a standard HVAC system but has shown to be an alternative cost reliable option to homes that do not have ductwork.

<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the room temperature, and after that change it ON. To avoid straining an ac system's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You ought to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
