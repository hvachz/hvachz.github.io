<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
