<p>A packaged system, usually installed on the roofing system, is most commonly used on commercial structures, but it is also an option for property owners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems include not just the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those seeking to save money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system independently, because the unit is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are usually just readily available for larger homes due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be an excellent way to save money on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more expensive than purchasing just a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the very best option for homeowners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budget plans.<p>
