<p>The homes and composition of the soil in an area can impact the rate at which heat is conducted through the ground.

Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda.

Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the ceilings, floorings, or walls covered by grills) carry cooled air from the a/c unit to the house. This cooled air becomes warmer as it distributes through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Learn how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
