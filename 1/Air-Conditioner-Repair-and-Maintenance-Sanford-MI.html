<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Companies in Sanford</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for consultation and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. However, a lot of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
