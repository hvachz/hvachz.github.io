<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for a/c repair, which you need to look out for. First, you should inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
