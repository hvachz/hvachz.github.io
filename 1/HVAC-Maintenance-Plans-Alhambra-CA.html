<h3>Passive Ventilation in Alhambra CA 91801</h3>
<p>I generally do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to change your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over options. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
