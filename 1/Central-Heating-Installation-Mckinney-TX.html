He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years back and know the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise pleased that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
