<p>Radiant heat covers a range of different heating unit, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar principles.

<h3>Gas Central Heating in Franklinton NC 27525</h3>
<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, managing the power to the heating wires and likewise controling the temperature of the flooring. All wiring for your radiant heating system either runs to it or from it. The majority of people will install their thermostat near the entryway of the room they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is great as long as the area is dry and unobstructed.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance items that only a trained HVAC technician will be able to do.

Also, clean ducts and correct air flow are essential to a well-functioning system, however house owners lack the necessary devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still necessary to have a specialist technician examine the system periodically.<p>
