<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many heating systems have multiple control panel. The biggest, or only one in some furnaces, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the brand-new control panel must be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work.
