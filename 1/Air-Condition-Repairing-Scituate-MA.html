<p>Filters can get filthy easily, particularly if you reside in a location that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all kinds of dust, debris, bacteria, and clean the air. They're responsible for maintaining the indoor air quality. Your HVAC system will ultimately stop performing as you expect it to if they're not cleaned and changed routinely. The cooling and heating will be inefficient and the indoor air quality will aggravate. Checking and altering the air filters is among the most essential elements of HVAC maintenance.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
