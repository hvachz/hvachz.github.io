<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as designed. Moisture management and humidity control may contravene efforts to try to optimize the operation to save energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperature levels (design levels), instead of the higher temperature levels often used to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for the majority of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, throughout most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need additional cooling to offer thermal comfort inside.

<p>Similar to a lot of house improvement tasks, the cost of a complete central heater can vary extensively based upon the size of the house. A lot of furnaces will last between 15 and 20 years.
