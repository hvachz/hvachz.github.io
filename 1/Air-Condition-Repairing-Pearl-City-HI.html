<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summertime cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>Reinstall the access panel and disconnect block. Turn on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and wait for the AC to start (see Be Client at Startup," listed below). The compressor ought to run and the condenser fan should spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor begins but the fan does not. Shut down the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Picture 7). Reinstall the blade and secure the cover. Then see and repower the system if the fan begins.
