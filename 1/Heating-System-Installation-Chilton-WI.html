<p>Another option to oil furnaces are gas heating systems While oil is generally utilized in locations where gas lines do not run, there are times when you might have a choice between the 2 types. Gas heaters cost about the very same, around $6,000 for a high-efficiency unit. The real advantage of utilizing a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your home.

<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to alter your filters regularly, they're not kidding. It's as important as a routine oil modification in your automobile. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps contaminants and particles in the air. Once every 3 months, Energy Star suggests replacing your filter. During high usage months, examine the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
