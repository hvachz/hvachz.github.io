<p>If the hvac company didn't come out ahead they would not offer agreements.  The so called trustworthy companies rip off more individuals than the fly by night outfits. I understand because I tried to work for them. I stop due to the fact that 90% of them are criminals. They walk in with or without an agreement and start offering you things you do not require. They lie. How do I know. I now work as a specialist to confirm the so called solutions and issues. 9 out of 10, I inspect are completely wrong.<p>
<p>Power resources: Confirm your access to electrical resources. Many older homes have restricted ability to include major devices at the level of a central air conditioner.

Your AC installer will understand what to search for.<p>
