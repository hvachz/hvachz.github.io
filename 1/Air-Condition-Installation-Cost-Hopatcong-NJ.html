<p>Airflow patterns in structure are figured out by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural impacts. Atmospheric pressure differences produced by these forces move air-borne contaminants from locations of greater pressure to areas of lower pressure through any readily available opening in building walls, ceilings, floorings, doors, windows, and HVAC systems.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Policy banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
