<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be offered by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>
