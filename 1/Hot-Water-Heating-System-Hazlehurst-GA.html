<p>Appropriate ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to believe that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are frequently 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same contaminants. Simply put, sometimes the air inside can be more hazardous than the air exterior.<p>
<p>The very first a/c unit and refrigerators used harmful or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that might lead to fatal mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<h3>The Way to Get Your HVAC Certification and HVAC Licensing in Hazlehurst GA</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to get rid of the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating system. We decided on getting something more costly than a traditional hot water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy expenses. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He knew just what the issue was and fixed it very rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness. The goal is to supply enough changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this.
