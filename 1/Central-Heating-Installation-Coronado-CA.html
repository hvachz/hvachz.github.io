Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
