The task of an HVAC technician is relatively complex and can differ substantially from one office or home to the next. Every maintenance job and repair is various from the last.

Generally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not sound like much, especially if the goal of owning a company was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it took to build the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't completion objective.
