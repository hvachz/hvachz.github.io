<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air problems by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often discharge pollutants.)

Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Regardless of the type of electric radiant floor heating unit, all are factory-built to remain in one piece and not cut, broken or altered.

However, assuming they are installed correctly and properly looked after, the probability of them having problems is small.<p>
