<h3>Ventilation Double Flux in Rosamond CA 93560</h3>
<p>I have actually been utilizing them for many years for my businesses, my own houses and my realty clients' homes. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with different costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me trouble shoot the concern when I called and he recommended me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again. He is truthful, trusted, and sensible on cost. It's tough to find a truthful AC man and I'm pleased I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
