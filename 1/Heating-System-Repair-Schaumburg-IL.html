<h3>Tips for Quick Furnace Repair at Schaumburg IL</h3>
<p>Even more recent heating systems less than five years old have been found as bad. Too many homeowners are surprised to learn that their 'brand-new' furnace  heat exchanger.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode".

This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
