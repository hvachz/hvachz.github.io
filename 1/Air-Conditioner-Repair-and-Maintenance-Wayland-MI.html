<p>Your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a range of contaminants that have the potential to negatively affect your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungis, bacteria, and really small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should examine and, if necessary, upgrade the building envelope. For instance, he may seal spaces and cracks in the external walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling costs. Insulation may be a more efficient service to your cooling problems than replacing your equipment.<p>
